# Functions and mathematical operators

In this session we will learn how to write (basic) custom
functions in _R_.
For some of the examples and the exercises we may need arithmetics
and mathematical functions.

We have already used some basic arithmetics such as addition (`+`)
or the power function (`^`) in the previous lessens. A full list
can be found on the _R_ documentation `?Arithmetic` (or `help(Arithmetic)`).
In addition to that we may use basic mathematical functions such as
sine and cosine (`sin`, `cos`), the exponential and natural logarithmic
function (`exp`, `log`), or others. A full list can be found on the help
page for `?Math`.

## Functions

Functions and control structures are what make your code more dynamic. In
programming, "functional programming" is a programming paradigm, a style how
code is written.  Rather than writing so called spaghetti code (one line
after another after another ...) functions and control structures allow
one to build code in blocks.
Writing functions and control structures makes the difference
between a pure user and a developer.

Functional programing helps to keep the code:

* more structured,
* more readable,
* and much easier to maintain or find errors.
    
Control structures are typically not used when using the interactive command
line, but are essential parts of of _each_ program and software we use.

Functions are sets of instructions which take over specific tasks.
One simple example is the function `sd` which computes the empirical
standard deviation of a set of numeric values. Mathematically the standard
deviation is defined as:

$\text{sd}(x) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N - 1} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \bar{x})^2} ~~|~~ i = 1, \dots, N$

Let's assume we have three numeric vectors and we need the standard
deviation from all of them.

```{r}
# Define some values
x1 <- rnorm(100, 0, 1)
x2 <- rnorm(100, 0, 1.5)
x3 <- rnorm(100, 0, 5)
# Calculate standard deviation once ...
sd1 <- sqrt(sum((x1-mean(x1))^2) / (length(x1)-1))
# ... and again, ...
sd2 <- sqrt(sum((x2-mean(x2))^2) / (length(x2)-1))
# ... and again ...
sd3 <- sqrt(sum((x3-mean(x3))^2) / (length(x3)-1))
print(c(sd1, sd2, sd3))
```

... even if the equation for the standard deviation is rather simple you can
easily see that the code is quickly getting complex and prone to errors!
Rather than doing this spaghetti-style-coding we write ourself a function.
Well, `sd` is a mathematical function from _R_ base, but here we will use
a simple hand-written sd function (I call it `sdfun`):

```{r}
# Define the function once:
sdfun <- function(x) {
  return(sqrt(sum((x - mean(x))^2) / (length(x) - 1)))
}
# Define some values
x1 <- rnorm(100, 0, 1)
x2 <- rnorm(100, 0, 1.5)
x3 <- rnorm(100, 0, 5)
# Calculate standard deviation
sd1 <- sdfun(x1)
sd2 <- sdfun(x2)
sd3 <- sdfun(x3)
print(c(sd1, sd2, sd3))
# Or even
print(c(sdfun(x1), sdfun(x2), sdfun(x3)))
```

## When should I use functions?

A good indicator is if you start **copy \& paste** code! Copy \& paste
means that you quite likely use the same thing (or something very
similar) over and over again.
Thus, think of writing a function instead!
Functions can be rather simple, or already more complex allowing to
control them in a way that they do the same thing but with slightly different
conditions. This is done by adding additional input arguments to the function
which allows one to control the function (control arguments).

As soon as your **code is getting** more **complicated**: think of extracting some
blocks/essential parts and put them into functions. The functions can be stored
in extra script files which drastically reduces the number of lines of code in your
main script and increases the readability. This helps _a lot_!

Whenever you have a block of **code you may reuse in the future**,
or a **block of code** you double-checked
and you are **sure it works well**: you may pack it into functions. This allows you to
reuse the function in the future, and, when searching for errors, you may not have
to check the code inside these functions as you are sure that they work as expected.

## The structure of functions

Functions consist of three key elements. These are:

* **input arguments**
* **instructions**
* **output or return values**

All three are optional. Well, if you have a function without instructions,
the function does absolutely nothing and would be completely useless, however,
technically an empty function can be created.

Input and output are also optional. You may have a function which has input
arguments but no output (e.g., a function that saves data to a file), or
no input but output (e.g., a function that reads data from a standard file).
However, these are special cases.

Typically functions have at least **inputs** and **instructions**, and most
will also **return** a result or at least an indication that the function
successfully executed the instructions.

## Functions in _R_

As we have learned in an earlier session nearly anything in _R_ is an object.
Functions are first class objects as well and can be used as all the other
objects or variables. This allows one to pass functions as input to other
function which is frequently used and an important feature in _R_, even if
it might be a bit confusing to people coming from other programming languages.

Functions can of course also be nested (a function calls another function as
part of the instructions), and functions can be used recursively (one function
may call itself several times) which is useful for some tasks.

Functions are often encapsulated (they take their input, do something, and
return a result without touching all the objects on the workspace). However,
they do not have to be encapsulated! _R_ uses lexical scoping and functions
may access variables on the workspace and/or other environments. This can
be very useful, but also a bit confusing.

## Calling functions

Function calls are indicated by round brackets (`(...)`). We have
already used a range of functions such as `seq(...)`, `mean(...)`,
`is.numeric(...)`, `as.numeric(...)`, or `plot(...)` over the past
weeks. A side note: _R_ differs between functions and so called
generic functions. Generic functions act differently depending on
the input. For example, `summary(c("A","B","A","B"))` and
`summary(1:50)` act different on character vectors and numeric
vectors. We will learn something about generic functions
in another session.

## Naming functions

You can basically use any name (as long as it is a valid variable/function
name). However, **you may overwrite existing functions** if the function 
name already exists! Thus, use meaningful, clear, and unique names and try
not to name all your functions `f` and `fun` and don't use existing names
such as `mean` or `plot` (except you know what you do).

In _R_ variables and functions with the same name can co-exist,
e.g.,:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
mean <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
mean(mean)
```

Here we define a numeric vector `mean` and calculate the 
arithmetic mean by calling `mean(mean)`. _R_ calls the
function `mean` using the vector `mean`. Even if this
works **try to avoid such constructs**!

## Functions In Real Life

We all come across function-like situations in our daily life multiple
times a day. One illustrative example are backing recipes. Imagine
you are cooking some brownies:

<div style="text-align: center;">
 <img style="width: 60%;" src="images/03/03_recipe.jpg">
</div>

Classical recipes are set up as follows:

* A list of the required ingredients (our **inputs**)
* A set of **instructions** (mix this, do that, bake for 180 minutes)
* And a delicious foto. Or, if you cook it, some nice food! That's
  the **result** or **output**.

We can even find more analogies on this screenshot:

* The name of the recipe is like the function name, the website
  where we have found the recipe is the name of the _R_ package (if
  the function is included in a package).

<div style="text-align: center;">
 <img style="width: 60%;" src="images/03/03_recipe2.jpg">
</div>

Thus, every time we call this "function" (use this recipe) with this
very specific name (Cocoa Brownies) from this specific package (or site,
the food network) using the inputs (ingredients) as specified 
we will always get the same result. And that's what functions do.

## Declare Functions in _R_

Let's begin with an empty function. As mentioned previously
all parts of a function (input, instructions, and output) are optional.
If we don't declare all three, that is what we will end up:

```{r, results = "hide", fig.align = "center"}
myfun <- function() {
    # Instructions
}
```

We define a new function called `myfun` by assigning a new `function()`
to the variable `myfun` as you would do it with e.g., numeric values (`x <- 3`).
Function inputs will be declared within the round brackets `()`, but this
function has no inputs. The instructions are defined inside the curly brackets `{...}`,
in this example it is simply a comment (no code; no instructions). And last but not
least, the function does not `return` anything at the end.

However, we just defined our first custom function! As for all other objects
we can examine the object using default methods such as `class` and `is.function`:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Get the class of myfun
class(myfun)
# Check if is function
is.function(myfun)
```

To be precise: functions _always_ return something even if nothing
is explicitly declared as in our empty function `myfun`. Returns
may be invisible as in this case, but _R_ returns something. Let's
store the return on `x` and see what we got:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Declare function
myfun <- function() {
    # Instructions
}
# Store return on x
x <- myfun()
# Examine
print(x)
class(x)
```

Our empty function returns a `NULL` (an object of class `"NULL"`).

## The NULL value in _R_

The `NULL` value in _R_ is what the `None` type is in python.
It is basically an object which tells us that it does not contain
anything (so `NULL` basically means "nothing").
`NULL` objects are used quite regularly and we might, every now
and then, check for `is.null` to check if we got an empty object.
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Define variable
x <- NULL
# Print
print(x)
# Check if is null
is.null(x)
```

## Back to functions

Let us write some more useful functions.

* **Input:** no input
* **Instructions:** print a string
* **Output:** no output
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Declare the function
myfun <- function() {
    print("Hello World!")
}
# Call function
myfun()
```

We can call our new `myfun` function by typing `myfun()` into
the console. As we have no input, nothing has to be declared
between the brackets (we are not even allowed to do so).
As soon as called the function executes the instructions. Here,
the string `"Hello World!"` is printed.

Again, we have not explicitly declared an output or return value, but
_R_ returns us something:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Store return value/output
x <- myfun()
print(x)
class(x)
```

As we can see the return, which is assigned to our variable `x`,
contains the very same character string the function printed.
**Why?** Well, this is a bit tricky to understand. _R_ always
returns the last return it can find. `print(...)` invisibly returns
what it just printed. Thus, the last return was the string itself (even
if we did not see it), wherefore our `myfun` function also returns this
at the end. It is not important to know the details, but keep that in
mind!

We now extend our function and provide an input argument:

* **Input:** one argument called `x`
* **Instructions:** combine two character strings (`paste`) and print it
* **Output:** no explicit return value
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Declare the function
myfun <- function(x) {
    print(paste("Good morning", x))
}
# Call function
myfun("Jochen")
```

We can now call our function `myfun` and provide (required) one
input, let's use the character string `"Jochen"` for now.
The function now takes this input argument and stores it - internally -
on the name `x` (as we named our input `x`).
Given the instructions the function combines the two character strings
`"Good morning"` and `x` and prints the result.

Once defined we can now reuse our function `myfun` with different
inputs:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
myfun("Helga")
myfun("Jose")
```

Define a return value:

* **Input:** one argument called `x`
* **Instructions:** combine two character strings (`paste`) and print it
* **Output:** return the number of characters of the pasted string

Again, extend the function from above. We now define an explicit return
value. But rather than just returning the combined string we are interested
in the number of characters the string had.

The instructions:

* paste the two character strings `"Good evening"` and `x` and store the
  new character string on a variable called `tmp`
* print the string `tmp`
* count the number of characters of the string `tmp` (that's what `nchar` does;
  _number of characters_)
* ... and return this number, an positive integer.
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Declare the function
myfun <- function(x) {
    # Create the string
    tmp <- paste("Good evening", x)
    # Print string
    print(tmp)
    # Return number of characters
    res <- nchar(tmp)
    return(res)
}
```

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Call function, store result
x <- myfun("Jochen")
# Print result
print(x)
# Class
class(x)
```

Et voila, our first "useful" function with inputs, instructions,
and an explicitly defined return value or output.
### Different formulations

In _R_ things can often be written in slightly different ways.
This also yields for function definitions.
Even if they are all valid and do the very same thing, some
of them are not recommended at all. What I recommend is to
always explicitly use the `return(...)` command because it makes it
much easier for you and all others reading your code
to identify what will be returned (increase readability)

Furthermore, except for very short functions, always use the 
curly brackets `{...}` as they structure your code. You can
easily identify the instructions as they are written between
brackets. For multi-line functions this is required anyways.


**Version 1:** <span style="color: green;">(recommended)</span>
```{r, results = "hide", fig.align = "center"}
powfun <- function(x) {
    return(x^2)
}
```


**Version 2:** as a one-liner <span style="color: green;">(recommended)</span>
```{r, results = "hide", fig.align = "center"}
powfun <- function(x) { return(x^2) }
```


**Version 3:** without brackets <span style="color: orange;">(ok for short functions)</span>
```{r, results = "hide", fig.align = "center"}
powfun <- function(x) return(x^2)
```


**Version 4:** without brackets, no explicit return
<span style="color: red;">(not recommended)</span>
```{r, results = "hide", fig.align = "center"}
powfun <- function(x) x^2
```


**Version 4:** without brackets, no explicit return
<span style="color: red;">(not recommended)</span>
```{r, results = "hide", fig.align = "center"}
powfun <- function(x) {
    x^2
}
```

### Multiple input arguments

Functions can have multiple input arguments and they do
not have to be named `x` (even if often used as the first
argument).
The following simple function has two inputs, one
called `greeting`, and one called `name`. We are expecting
two strings, paste them together (`paste`), and return the
new character string. In contrast to the functions shown
earlier in this document the function itself does not print
the new string, but returns it at the end of the function.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Function with two required arguments
myfun <- function(greeting, name) {
    # Store combined string
    res <- paste(greeting, name)
    return(res)
}
```

Functions with multiple arguments can be used the very
same way, except that we have to provide two input
arguments separated by a colon.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Call the function
x <- myfun("Welcome to the course,", "Jordan")
print(x)
```


## Practical Session

Let's do some practical work in this session.

### Exercise 1

1. write a function `powfun2` with one
   input argument `x` which returns $x^2$ (`?Arithmetic`)
2. write a function `powfun4` with one
   input argument `x` which returns $x^4$

**Solution:**
```{r}
# One input argument 'x', returns 'x^2'
# Input: numeric vector 'x'.
# Return: numeric vector of the same
# length, x to the power of 2.
powfun2 <- function(x) {
  return(x^2)
}
# One input argument, just for demonstration purpuses
# I call it 'z' here! Returns input^4, or z^4.
# Input: numeric vector 'x'.
# Return: numeric vector of the same
# length, x to the power of 2.
powfun4 <- function(z) {
  return(z^4)
}
```

### Exercise 2

1. write a function `powfun` with two
   input arguments to calculate $x^y$.
   Return the result.

**Solution:** The two functions from exercise 1 are
extremely similar, except they use a different power
parameter. If you write functions, you may write them
as general as necessary. Thus, let us define one function
which is able to do both:

```{r}
# Flexible custom power function
# Input: x numeric, the 'base'
#        y numeric, the power exponent
# Return: Numeric vector with x^y
powfun <- function(x, y) {
  return(x^y)
}
```
Note that the function now has two inputs, namely `x` and
`y`. You could add additional inputs by simply adding them
(comma separated), e.g., `function(x, y, a, b, foo, bar)` if needed.

Testing the functions:
```{r}
# 3 to the power of 2
powfun2(3)
# 3 to the power of 4
powfun4(3)
# The same with the powfun function:
powfun(3, 2)
powfun(3, 4)
```

### Exercise 3

Combine exercise 1 & 2:

1. overwrite your existing functions `powfun2` and `powfun4`
   by creating new functions with the same name. Rather
   than calling `x^2` and `x^4` explicitly these functions should
   internally call the function from exercise 2 and return
   its results (nesting functions, one of your functions internally
   uses another function).
2. what happens if the inputs are vectors,
   what if they are vectors of different lengths?
3. extend the function from Exercise 2,
   check you get valid inputs (define 'valid' on your own)

**Solution:** I am sorry this was rather confusing. What I had
planned is that you re-declare `powfun2` and `powfun4` (overwrite the
existing ones) and, internally, call `powfun` rather than hard-coding
`x^2` or `x^4` inside `powfun2` and `powfun4`.
So what we do is to define `powfun2 <- function(x) { ... }` but now
call `powfun` inside (so include `powfun` in the instructions `{...}`).

For the new `powfun2`: As we would like
to "return the input to the power of two", we use "2" as the
second input argument to "powfun". As the first input we forward
`x`. What happens is that we call `powfun2` with some data on input `x`.
`powfun2` does not do anything with `x` but directly "forwards" it to
the `powfun` function (as first input argument to `powfun`).
The second input is "2" (always 2 in this case):

```{r}
# Re-declare functions
powfun2 <- function(x) {
  # Call powfun: forward "x", set the second argument to "2"
  # "powfun" does the calculation for us.
  res <- powfun(x, 2)
  return(res)
}
```
  
The very same for the new `powfun4` but using "4" as the second
argument when calling the `powfun` function (inside `powfun4`).

```{r}
# Re-declare functions
powfun2 <- function(z) {
  # Call powfun: forward "z", set the second argument to "2"
  # "powfun" does the calculation for us.
  res <- powfun(z, 2)
  return(res)
}
```
Again, I used `z` as input here to illustrate that the input
of the function `powfun2` is a different object/variable than
the input `x` on `powfun(x, y)`.


What happens if call `powfun` with two vectors (for the two
inputs) of different lengt?
If `x` is of length `1` or `y` is
of length `1` it is kind of obvious:

```{r}
# First argument 2, second argument is c(2,3,4)
powfun(2, c(2, 3, 4))
```
The result is a vector c($2^2$, $2^3$, $2^4$) (base is always `2`).

```{r}
# First argument a vector c(2,3,4), second argument is 2:
powfun(c(2, 3, 4), 2)
```
The result is a vector c($2^2$, $3^2$, $4^2$) (power exponent is always `2`).

```{r}
# First argument a vector c(2,3,4),
# the second argument is a vector c(4,3,2):
powfun(c(2, 3, 4), c(4,3,2))
```
Now _R_ performs element-wise or pair-wise calculation. Thus, the
result is a vector c($2^4$, $3^3$, $4^2$).

Less obvious: if the first argument is of length 2, the second one
of length 4,  or the other way around.

```{r}
# First argument a vector c(2,3)
# the second argument is a vector c(2,3,4,5):
powfun(c(2, 3), c(2, 3, 4, 5))
```
The first vector is recycled to match the length of the second vector!
Thus R is actually calculating `c(2, 3, 2, 3)^(2, 3, 4, 5)` and we get
c($2^2$, $3^3$, $2^4$, $3^5$). This is not how I would use such a function,
but to demonstrate what _R_ does in these cases.

Similar in this case:
```{r}
# First argument a vector c(2,3,4,5)
# the second argument is a vector c(2,3):
powfun(c(2, 3, 4, 5), c(2, 3))
```
The second vector is recycled to match the length of the first vector!
Thus R is actually calculating `c(2, 3, 4, 5)^(2, 3, 2, 3)`
(c($2^2$, $3^3$, $4^2$, $5^3$)).

If the two length of the vectors is not a multiple of the first one,
e.g, the first is of length 2, the second of length 3, _R_ still tries
to recycle the short one, but will warn you that this is not possible.

```{r}
powfun(c(2, 3), c(2, 3, 4))
```

Checking inputs: we will learn about this in the next session, as
we will make use of conditions and other control structures.
