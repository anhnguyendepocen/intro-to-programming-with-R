# Control Structures (1)

So far we have only written very simple functions and scripts which always
did the very same. To make the code more dynamic we need so called control
statements. The following ones exist in _R_ and we will learn how they work
over the next few sessions.

* `if` and \code{else}: test a condition and act on it
* `for`: loop over a _fixed number_ of items
* `while`: execute loop `while` a condition is `TRUE`
* `repeat`: an infinite loop (until `break` stops it)
* `break`: stop/break execution of a loop
* `next`: skip iteration, continue loop
* `return`: exit a function (returns result)

The following comic can be seen as a function with a set of control
statements.

* the whole flowchart can be seen as a function `start_homework`
* there are a set of `if`-`else` conditions (if something is `Yes` do this,
   else to that)
* the loop in the bottom right corner is a `while` loop. While (or "as long as")
   more than `12` hours left until submission: procrastinate.

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are an essential part of control structures.
Check "Session 02, Exercise B" and read the _R_ documentation
`?Logical` and `?Comparison` (help pages) for more details.

## If conditions

The most basic control structure is the single `if` condition.

**Basic usage:**

* Structure: `if (<condition>) { <action> }`
* The condition _has to be a single logical value_ (`TRUE` or `FALSE`).
* The action between the curly brackets is executed if and only if the
    condition is `TRUE`.

**An example:**
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Define x
x <- 8
# Check if x > 10
if (x > 10) { print("x is larger than 10") }
if (x > 10) print("x is larger than 10")
```

There are different ways how to write `if` conditions. According
to [Headley Wickhams style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)
the following two ways are the preferred ones:

**Short:**
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
x <- 8
```

```{r, results = "hide", fig.align = "center"}
if (x > 10) print("x is larger than 10")
```

**For longer `<action>`s on multiple lines:**
```{r, results = "hide", fig.align = "center"}
if (x > 10) {
  print("x is larger than 10")
}
```

That's nice, but where can we use it?

### Conditional return 

Session 03, Exercise B: pool price.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide", fig.align = "center"}
do_something <- function(x, ...) return(x)
```

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
calculate_costs <- function(width, height, depth, price) {
    # If input price is smaller or equal to 0 return NA
    if (price <= 0) return(NA)
    # Else do something
    res <- width * height * depth * price
    return(res)
}
```

### Stop execution

We can now use conditions to stop our script conditional on
e.g., our input arguments using `stop("...")`. Don't mix `stop` with
`quit(...)`! `quit` will quit RStudio (or _R_ in general), `stop` stops
the execution of a script.
In this example the execution will be stopped if the inputs
are not numeric (`x` and/or `y`).

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
powfun <- function(x, y) {
  # Check if x, y are numeric
  if (!is.numeric(x)) stop("input x has to be numeric")
  if (!is.numeric(y)) stop("input y has to be numeric")
  # Return the result
  return(x^y)
}
```

We can, of course, add a set of different checks, e.g., check
that both inputs are numeric and of length 1:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
powfun <- function(x, y) {
  # Check if x, y are numeric
  if (!is.numeric(x)) stop("input x has to be numeric")
  if (!is.numeric(y)) stop("input y has to be numeric")
  # Both have to be of length one
  if (length(x) != 1) stop("input x has to be of length 1")
  if (length(y) != 1) stop("input y has to be of length 1")
  # Return the result
  return(x^y)
}
```

This is the very same (again, check that `x` and `y` are numeric
of length 1) but using logical or (`|`):
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
powfun <- function(x, y) {
  # Check if x, y are numeric
  if (!is.numeric(x) | !is.numeric(y)) {
      stop("input x, y have to be numeric")
  }
  # Both have to be of length one
  if (length(x) != 1 | length(y) != 1) {
    stop("input x, y have to be of length 1")
  }
  # Return the result
  return(x^y)
}
```

Or using only one condition. **Note**: compare this version to the
one two further up. While they do the same this one is much more compact,
however, the error message you will get is much less detailed. Thus, if
you get an error here (`stop(...)` is called) it is not obvious what
happened exactly. Thus, it strongly depends on your task whether you want
to have compact conditions or detailed messages.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
powfun <- function(x, y) {
  # Check if x, y are numeric and of length 1
  if (!is.numeric(x) | !is.numeric(y) | length(x) != 1 | !length(y) == 1) {
    stop("input x, y have to be numeric of length 1")
  }
  # Return the result
  return(x^y)
}
```

### Another example

Another example from Session 03, Exercise A:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
celsius_to_fahrenheit <- function(x) {
  if (!is.numeric(x)) stop("x must be numeric")
  return(x * 9 / 5 + 32)
}
fahrenheit_to_celsius <- function(x) {
  if (!is.numeric(x)) stop("x must be numeric")
  return((x - 32) * 5 / 9)
}
```

We cannot only check input arguments using control statements,
we can also use them to check results and other things.
Remember: in Session 02, Exercise A one of the tasks was to
convert temperatures from degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit
and back and check if the temperatures are the same at the end.
If not, you have a problem with your functions.

Let's start with a numeric vector `temp_celsius` and convert
the temperatures into degrees Fahrenheit and back. The resulting
vector is `temp_celsius2`.
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Convert temperatures
temp_celsius    <- c(0.3, -5.2, 38.3, NA, 34.1)
temp_fahrenheit <- celsius_to_fahrenheit(temp_celsius)
temp_celsius2   <- fahrenheit_to_celsius(temp_fahrenheit)
```

We could now use an `if` condition in our script to compare
these two vectors and **stop** if they are not equal before
using them to calculate something else.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Stop if not equal
if (!all.equal(temp_celsius, temp_celsius2)) {
    stop("Whoops, something is wrong with the conversion")
}
```


## If else conditions

The next extension of simple `if` statements are the `if-else`
statements. 

* Structure: `if (<condition>) \{ <action 1> \} else \{ <action 2> \}`
* Additional `else` code block (optional)
* If the condition is `TRUE` "`<action 1>`" is executed, else "`<action 2>`".

**A simple example:**
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Create object x
x <- 22
# Is a larger than 10?
if (x > 10) { print("x is > 10") } else { print("x is <= 10") }
```

Again, _R_ allows you to write `if-else` conditions differently.
According to the [style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)
the following to ways are good:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
x <- 8
```

**One-liner:**
```{r, results = "hide", fig.align = "center"}
if (x > 10) { print("x is larger than 10") } else { print("x is smaller or equal to 10") }
```

**Over multiple lines:**
```{r, results = "hide", fig.align = "center"}
if (x > 10) {
  print("x is larger than 10") 
} else {
  print("x is smaller or equal to 10")
}
```

### Multiple conditions

We can also combine multiple `if-else` conditions and next
them. In this example the `else` action contains another
`if-else` control statement.
```{r, results = "hide", fig.align = "center"}
x <- 10

# First if-else statement
if (x < 10) {
  x <- x^2
} else {
  # Second if-else statement (nested)
  if (x > 10) {
     print("The result is larger than 10!")
  } else {
     print("Exactly 10!")
  }
}
```

In this example `"Exactly 10!"` will be printed. The outer condition
(`x < 10`) is `FALSE` why "`else`" will be executed.
In `else` we see a second `if-else` block. The condition of this
inner `if-else` statement is also `FALSE` (`x > 0`) wherefore
"`else`"  of the inner control statement will be executed.
### if, else if, else

The next and last extension are additional `else if` conditions.
They are executed sequentially!

* If the first condition (`if`) is `FALSE` check the next condition
* Check first `else if` condition. If `TRUE` execute, else check
   the next one (in this case it's `else`).
* Note that only one will be used!

```{r, results = "hide", fig.align = "center"}
x <- 4

# One if, else if, else condition
if (x < 10) {
  x <- x^2
} else if (x > 10) {
  print("The result is larger than 10!")
} else {
  print("Exactly 10!")
}
```

In this example nothing will be printed. The first condition
(`x < 10`) is `TRUE` and the first action will be executed.
All done there is to take `x` to the power of `2` (`x <- x^2`).
This will change our `x` and `x` will be `16` at the end (`4^2`)
but we will _not run into `else if`_ as the first `if` was `TRUE`
and only one will be executed!
We can use multiple `else if` conditions. Again: only one
will be executed, the first one that is `TRUE` (or run into
the `else` if none of them is `TRUE`. All others will be skipped.

Another example: what will be printed, if anything?
```{r, results = "hide", fig.align = "center"}
x <- 4

# First condition
if (x < 10) {
  x <- x^2
}

# Second condition
if (x > 10) {
  print("The result is larger than 10!")
} else {
  print("Exactly 10!")
}
```

In contrast to the one example two further up we are not using
an `if`, `else if`, `else` here, but an `if`, and a second `if-else`!
Thus, something different happens. These are two separate control structures
and the will be executed one after another.

1. `x < 10` is true, so the action of the upper `if` statement will be
   executed. The action is `x <- x^2` which will _overwrite our object `x`_ and
   store `16` on `x`.
2. Now the second `if-else` statement is considered. As we have modified our `x`
   the condition `x > 10` is `TRUE` and `"The result is larger than 10!"` will be printed.

## Control Structures

Last time we have been looking at if conditions which allow you
to conditionally execute code. This time we will have a quick
look at `for`, `while`, and `repeat` loops and the
`break`, `next`, and `return` keywords/functions.

* `if` and \code{else}: test a condition and act on it
* `for`: loop over a _fixed number_ of items
* `while`: execute loop `while` a condition is `TRUE`
* `repeat`: an infinite loop (until `break` stops it)
* `break`: stop/break execution of a loop
* `next`: skip iteration, continue loop
* `return`: exit a function (returns result)


## `for` loops

`for` loops are used frequently when writing scripts to execute
a set of instructions multiple times e.g.:

* read a set of input files
* do calculations for a set of values
* search for specific data
* ...

## Basic usage

* Structure: `for (<value> in <values>) { <action> }`
* `<value> is the current ``loop object'', `<values>` a set of
    (different) values over which one would like to iterate
* the `<action>` is executed for each `<value>` in `<values>`
* `<values>` can be vectors or lists, typically vectors are
    used (integer vectors, numeric vectors, or character vectors)
* **Note:** _R_ has no for-loop constructor like `for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) { ... }`
    as many other programming languages do. The _R_ equivalent would is
    `for (i in 1:n) { ... }`

## For loops over vectors

The following for loop iterates over an integer
vector `c(1L, 2L, 3L)` starting with `i = 1L` and
iterates over `i = 2L` and `i = 3L`. 
The `for` loop ends after iterating over all elements
in the vector.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# For loop over an integer
# vector with 3 elements
for (i in c(1L, 2L, 3L)) {
  print(i)
}
```

In _R_ we can also use a character vector to loop over.
E.g., looping over a set of names (character vector `c("Reto", "Ben", "Lea")`,
the loop object here is called `name`:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# For loop over a character
# vector with 3 elements
for (name in c("Reto", "Ben", "Lea")) {
  print(name)
}
```

Instead of writing `for (i in c(1L, 2L, 3L)) ...` we can also
loop over an existing object. In the example below we create
an integer vector `x <- 1:5` which we use in the for loop.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Define the vector over
# which we will loop
x <- 1:5
```

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# For loop
for (i in x) {
  print(i)
}
```

The very same yields for character vectors.
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Define the vector over
# which we will loop
participants <- c("Reto", "Ben", "Lea")
```

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# For loop
for (name in participants) {
  print(name)
}
```

We can also define a `for` loop over a "reverse" sequence (a decreasing
sequence), e.g., a sequence `3`, `2`, `1` by either defining a 
decreasing sequence `3:1`:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Looping "backwards"
# (decreasing integers)
for (i in 3:1) { print(i) }
```

or by using the `rev(...)` (reverse) function. The reverse function
simply reverses all elements. Thus, `rev(c(1L, 2L, 3L))` is 
identical to `c(3L, 2L, 1L)`:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Or using "rev" (reverse)
x <- 1:3
for (i in rev(x)) { print(i) }
```

The very same yields for character vectors.
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
participants <- c("Reto",
                  "Ben",
                  "Lea")
for (name in rev(participants)) {
    print(name)
}
```

Loops can also be nested. Most often this is used in a
matrix context (looping over data in a matrix). We will
talk about matrices next week!

Frequently used: a nested `for` loop over two loop indices
called `i` and `j` (in matrices corresponding to rows and columns).
```{r, echo = TRUE, results = "hide", fig.align = "center"}
# Nested for loops
for (i in 1:3) {
  for (j in 1:2) {
    print(c(i, j))
  }
}
```

The outer `for` loop iterates over `i = c(1L, 2L, 3L)`, the 
inner one over `j = c(1L, 2L)`. The result is the following:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Nested for loops
for (i in 1:3) {
  for (j in 1:2) {
    print(c(i, j))
  }
}
```

At first, the outer loop sets `i = 1L` and executes its instructions
(the inner `for` loop). The inner `for` loop sets `j = 1L` (thus, the
first `print` prints `1 1`; `i = 1L`, `j = 1L`). As the inner `for`
loop is not yet finished, `j` will be set to `j = 2L` and we get the
output `1 2` (`i = 1L`, `j = 2L`). After that the inner loop finished, thus
we proceed with the outer loop and set `i = 2L` and, again, execute
the instructions (which is the inner `for` loop). The inner loop
now iterates over `j = 1L` and `j = 2L` again which gives us the
output `2 1` and `2 2`. Then, `i` is set to `i = 3`, the inner loop
is executed once more (gives `3 1` and `3 2`). Now the outer loop
is finished and the script ends.

## Combine loops and if/else conditions

To create more dynamic loops we can also combine loops (not
limited to `for` loops) with additional control structures
such as `if` statements.

The example below loops over `i in 1:n` (as `n <- 3L` it
loops over `i = 1L`, `i = 2L`, and `i = 3L`) and, conditional
in `i`, a string is printed.

```{r, echo = TRUE, results = "hide", fig.align = "center"}
# Upper limit for the loop
n <- 3L
for (i in 1:n) {
  if (i < n) { print("ice") } else { print("baby") }
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
# Upper limit for the loop
n <- 3L
for (i in 1:n) {
  if (i < n) { print("ice") } else { print("baby") }
}
```

There are special control statements for loops, namely
`return` (only used for loops in functions), `next`, and `break`.

## Use next and break

`next` and `break` are no functions but control statements
(simply `next` or `break`, not `next()` or `break()`).

* `next` is used to skip one iteration. Whenever called inside a
   loop, the current iteration of this loop is skipped and the
   loop continues with the next iteration (_but does not stop_).
* the `break` statement stops the execution of the loop. Can be
   used to stop the execution of a loop early.


### How to use next

The following lines show how `next` can be used in a loop.
We have a `for` loop which iterates over all `<var>` in `<vars>`
and has an additional if condition. Whenever this condition is `TRUE`,
`next` is called which skips the current iteration and proceeds with
the next one (next `<var>` in the sequence `<vars>`).

```
for (<var> in <vars>) {
  if (<condition) {
      next
  }
}
```


### How to use break

Very similar to the example above we are looping over a set of
`<var>` along `<vars>`. As soon as the additional if `<condition>` is
`TRUE`, `break` will be called. `break` will immediately stop the iteration
no matter at which position of `<vars>` we are.

```
for (<var> in <vars>) {
  if (<condition>) {
      break
  }
}
```


## Practical exercises

* **A:** Write a `for` loop which iterates over an **integer sequence**
         `from = 1` up `to = 30` and print the loop variable.
* **B:** Use the same loop as in **A**, but `break` if loop variable is larger than or equal to 10.
* **C:** Use the same loop as in **A**, print the loop variable and whether it is odd or even.
* **D:** Use the same loop as in **A**, skip all odd numbers using `next`.

## Looping over vector indices

Quite often you will loop over a set of indices (e.g., `for (i in 1:100)`)
and use these indices to access data in vectors, lists, matrices,
and other objects.
If you forgot how vector subsetting by indices work please go trough
the "Vector Subsetting" section of Session 02 (Help & Vectors).

As an example: Let's imagine we have two character vectors of the same
length called `first_name` and `last_name` containing the names of 
some individuals. The first element in a vector in _R_ is always index `1`
(not `0` as in other programming languages), the last element in this
example is `6` as the vectors have a length of 6 (`length(first_name)` is `6`).
Thus, we can do something like this:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Two character vectors with a set of names
first_name <- c("Lea",     "Sabine", "Mario", "Lea", "Peter",   "Max")
last_name  <- c("Schmidt", "Gross",  "Super", "Kah", "Steiner", "Muster")
```

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Loop over indizes
for (i in 1:6) {
  print(first_name[i])
}
```


The `for` loop iterates over an integer vector (`1:6`) containing the
values `1L`, `2L`, ..., `6L` wherefore `i = 1L` for the first iteration,
`i = 2L` for the second iteration, and so far and so on.
Using vector subsetting by index we can now print the `i`th element
of our vector `first_name` by simply calling `print(first_name[i])`.


A slightly more useful example (yes, we could solve it without loops)
is the following: We will loop over `i in 1:6` and check if the `i`th
element of the vector `first_name` is `"Lea"`. If the condition is `TRUE`
we have found a person called `"Lea"` and we will print her full name.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Two character vectors with a set of names
first_name <- c("Lea",     "Sabine", "Mario", "Lea", "Peter",   "Max")
last_name  <- c("Schmidt", "Gross",  "Super", "Kah", "Steiner", "Muster")
```

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Loop over indizes
for (i in 1:6) {
  if (first_name[i] == "Lea") {
    print(paste("Found a", first_name[i], last_name[i]))
  }
}
```


The only thing which is not so nice is that we have hardcoded `1:6`
here. As soon as you would get a new vector of names the script would not
work anymore (as you may iterate over the wrong number of elements).
Thus, _we should try to avoid such hard-coded commands/instructions_
in our code whenever possible.


There are two options to do so. Most obvious is to replace `6` by `length(first_name)`.
If you change the length of `first_name` we will still loop over all elements.
Another way in _R_ to do the same is to call the `seq_along` function. `seq_along(x)`
returns an integer sequence `from = 1` to `to = length(x)` (in our case `x` is
our object `first_name`) and can thus be used for looping over an object.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
1:length(first_name)     # Use "length(first_name)"
seq_along(first_name)    # Use seq_along
```

Et voila:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Use "length(first_name)" instead of hard-coding 6
for (i in seq_along(first_name)) {
  if (first_name[i] == "Lea") {
    print(paste("Found a", first_name[i], last_name[i]))
  }
}
```

## Using next and break

The `for` loop above prints the name as soon as `first_name[i] == "Lea"`.
We could also program it the other way around and do the following:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Loop over indizes
for (i in seq_along(first_name)) {
  # We want to find only "Lea"s
  if (first_name[i] != "Lea") next
  # Else print
  print(paste("Found a", first_name[i], last_name[i]))
}
```


As described earlier, `next` skips the current iteration.
In this example we check `first_name[i] != "Lea"`. If this is `TRUE`
(if this is _not a_ `"Lea"`) we call `next` which skips this iteration/person.
Thus, the `print` command is only executed when `first_name[i] != "Lea"` is
`FALSE`, or in other words, whenever `first_name[i] == "Lea"`.


An example for the `break` statement: We still have the same
character vectors `first_name` and `last_name` and we will find
the first person called `"Mario"`, but only one. To do so we can
do the following:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Loop over indizes
for (i in seq_along(first_name)) {
  # We want to find only "Lea"s
  if (first_name[i] == "Mario") { 
    print(paste("Found someone called", last_name[i], first_name[i]))
    break
  }
  print(paste(i, "is no Mario"))
}
```


The `for` loop is again looping over all elements `i in seq_along(first_name)`
and checks if the element `first_name[i]` of the current iteration is `"Mario"`.
As soon as the script finds a `"Mario"` the condition `first_name[i] == "Mario"`
is `TRUE` and the name of the person is printed. After the `print` command
`break` is called which immediately stops the `for` loop execution. Thus,
the `for` loop stops at `i = `r i`` as the `r i`th person is a `"Mario"`.


## while loops


Another loop constructor is `while`. `while` executes a set of instructions
while a condition is `TRUE` (or, until the condition is `FALSE`).

**Basic usage**

* Structure: `while (<condition>) { <action> }`
* The `<condition>` _has to be_ logical `FALSE` or `TRUE`.
* The `<action>` is executed as long as the `<condition>` is `TRUE`.

**WARNING:** Take care of infinite loops! The following
code chunk will run forever.

```
# Define x
x <- 1
# Increase x by 1 as long as ...
while (x < 0) {
  x <- x + 1
}
```

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="images/04/04_flowchart_trap_xkcd.png" style="width: 30%;">

An example for a `while` loop: Print all numbers `x` in $1, 2, ..., \infty$
as long as `x^2` is lower than 20.
Start with `x <- 0`.

* Iteration 1: $0^2 = 0$ and thus lower than 20 (the condition is `TRUE`).
   At the end `x` is increased by `1` (`x <- x + 1`) and the
   next iteration is started.
* Iteration 2: `x` is now `1`, $1^2 = 1$ is still `< 20` and the condition is still `TRUE`.
   Thus, increase `x` and continue.
* Iteration 3: `x` is `2`, $2^2 = 4$, `x^2 < 20` is `TRUE`, increase `x`, continue.
* Iteration 4: `x` is `3`, $3^2 = 9$, `x^2 < 20` is `TRUE`, increase `x`, continue.
* Iteration 4: `x` is `4`, $4^2 = 16$, `x^2 < 20` is `TRUE`, increase `x`, continue.
* Iteration 5: `x` is now `5`. As $5^2 = 25$ the condition `x^2 < 20` is no longer
   `TRUE` and the `while` loop stops.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Start with 0
x <- 0
# Loop until condition is FALSE
while (x^2 < 20) {
  print(x)      # Print x
  x <- x + 1    # Increase x by 1
}
```


## Store Interim Results

Often you would like to keep interim results (the values of the
different iterations) rather than only having the one value at the
very end of the loop. To do so we have to store the result of each
iteration into a suitable object, e.g., a numeric vector.

An example: Let us try the following. We will start with an initial
value of `1.0` and multiply it by `1.5` six times. We could write it
as follows:

```{r}
x <- 1.0
for (i in 1:6) {
  x <- x * 1.5
}
print(x)
```

And we can see that the result is ``r x``. However, we might be interested
in the interim steps (what is `1.0 * 1.5`, what is `1.0 * 1.5 * 1.5` and so far and so on).

To do so let's create an empty numeric vector `x` of length `7` using
`vector("numeric", 7)`. The exercise was to multiply `1.5` six times, however
we also have to store our initial value on `x` wherefore we need `7` elements
in our vector (and not `6`). This creates a vector containing `7` `0`s.
On the first element (`x[1L]` we store our initial value `1.0`.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
N <- 7                    # Length of the vector
x <- vector("numeric", N) # Empty vector of length N
x[1L] <- 1.0              # Set the first element to 1.0
print(x)
```

In let's write the `for` loop. The first element contains our 
initial value, thus we will loop over `i = 2:7` (`i in c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)`;
which is `6` iterations).
In each iteration we take the previous element of `x` (e.g.,
when `i = 2` we will use `x[i - 1] = x[1L]`; the first element),
multiply this element with `1.5`, and directly store it on `x[i] = x[2L]`.
In the  next iteration we do the same but using `i = 3L` and so far and so on.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Loop over 2:N, store results in x
for (i in 2:N) {
  x[i] <- x[i - 1L] * 1.5
}
print(x)
```

But let us do this step-by-step. In a first step we defined ourself
a vector `x` of length `7`. We can "visualize" this vector as follows:

<div>
  <img src="images/05/05_vector_subsetting1.png" style="width: 50%;">
</div>

By index, the first element of the vector is `x[1L]`, the second one
`x[2L]` and so far and so on (_R_ starts with 1, not 0).
Given a second object `i = 1L` (a vector index) we can also rewrite
this as follows:

<div>
  <img src="images/05/05_vector_subsetting2.png" style="width: 50%;">
</div>

`x[i]` is the first element as `i = 1L`. The second element is
`x[i + 1L]` as `i + 1L = 2L`, and the last one `x[i + 6L]` as we have
`7` elements (`i + 6L = 7L`).

In our example (multiply `1.0` six times with `1.5`) we 
first define a vector of length `7` and set `x[1L]` to `1` which gives
us the following numeric vector:

<div>
  <img src="images/05/05_vector_inter1.png" style="width: 50%;">
</div>

So far, not very impressive.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
N <- 7                    # Length of the vector
x <- vector("numeric", N) # Empty vector of length N
x[1L] <- 1.0              # Set the first element to 1.0
print(x)
```

In the second step we write the `for` loop, looping over
`i = 2:7`.
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
for (i in 2:7) { x[i] <- x[i - 1] * 1.5 }
```

In the first iteration of the `for` loop 
`i` is set to `2L`. Inside the loop we compute
`x[i - 1] * 1.5` and directly store it on `x[i]`.
Thus, we store `x[1L] * 1.5` on `x[2L]` (or `x[2L] <- x[1L] * 1.5`).

<div>
  <img src="images/05/05_vector_inter2.png" style="width: 50%;">
</div>

<div>
  <img src="images/05/05_vector_inter3.png" style="width: 50%;">
</div>

In the next iteration `i` is set to `3L` and we store
`x[3L] <- x[2L] * 1.5` and so far ans so on ...

<div>
  <img src="images/05/05_vector_inter4.png" style="width: 50%;">
</div>

<div>
  <img src="images/05/05_vector_inter5.png" style="width: 50%;">
</div>

... until we reach `x[7L] <- x[6L] * 1.5`, the end of our loop.

<div>
  <img src="images/05/05_vector_inter6.png" style="width: 50%;">
</div>

At the end we have stored all the interim results on `x` which
now looks as follows:

<div>
  <img src="images/05/05_vector_inter6.png" style="width: 50%;">
</div>

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
for (i in 2:7) { x[i] <- x[i - 1] * 1.5 }
print(x)
```

Another way to store interim results is to `append(...)`.
`append(x, y)` simply appends `y` to `x` (identical to `c(x, y)`).
This is especially
required if we don't know the final length of our object, in this case `x`.
The following `while` loop does the following:

* Start with `x <- 1`.
* In each iteration set `x <- x * 1.5`.
* As long as `x < 100` continue.

As we are not looping over a fixed number of iterations (e.g., `for (i in 1:5)`)
we do not know how many iterations will be necessary until `x >= 100`.
Thus, we have to store our results differently.

* Create a second object `res` and store the initial value on it (`res <- x`).
* In each iteration append the new `x` to `res`. This adds the new `x` at the
   end of `res` and increases the length of `res` by `1`.
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
x   <- 1  # Initial value of x: will be modified
res <- x  # Store initial value on "res"
while (x < 100) {
  # Compute new x
  x <- x * 1.5
  # Append new x to vector "res"
  res <- append(res, x)
}
print(res)
print(length(res))
```

Our final object `res` is of length `13`. `12` iterations were required
until `x` got `>= 100` (`12` iterations but length `13` as we also stored
our initial value on `res`).

**Note:** if possible try to define your vector
in advance (much faster). However, this is only possible if you know how many
iterations will be required (e.g., in the `for` loop). If not, `append(...)`
can be used.

## Practical Session

### Exercise 1: Arithmetic mean

Calculate the arithmetic mean over a sequence of 
random numeric values from a Gaussian distribution (`rnorm(...)`)
using a `for` loop (without `sum(...)` and `mean(...)`).

The arithmetic mean is defined as: $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \big(x_i\big)$
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
set.seed(100)   # Fix random numbers
x <- rnorm(12)  # Draw a set of random numbers
print(x)
# What is the mean of x?
```



### Exercise 2: Conditional for loop

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
set.seed(7)
x <- sample(-10:20, size = 15, replace = TRUE)
print(x)
```


1. Write a `for` loop (do _not_ hard-code `i in 1:15`
    which loops over the vector and divide all negative
    values by `5`.
2. Loop over the original vector `x` using
    a `for` loop. If an element is negative: overwrite it
    with the previous element in the vector (e.g.,
    replace `-7` with `2`). Do the same but replace with next element.
3. What happens if you use different random numbers?

### Exercise 3: Factorial

In mathematics, the factorial of a positive integer $n$
(denoted by $n!$) is the product all positive integers less than
or equal to $n$ (and, by definition, $0! = 1$).

* An example: $3! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 = 6$
* Write a small function which takes one input argument `n`
  which returns `n!` using a `for` loop. Try the same
  using a `while` loop.

**Hint:** You may use a decreasing sequence, e.g., `i in 3:1`!
