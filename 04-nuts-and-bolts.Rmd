# Nuts and Bolts

_R_ is an object oriented programming language. In _R_ basically
everything is an object. Objects can be:

* defined variables (e.g., `a`, `b`, `result`),
* functions (e.g., `mean`, `max`, `sin`),
* connection handlers,
* ... (as I said, basically everything).

Each object in _R_ has a specific class and can have a set of
class-specific attributes and generic functions (or methods).

## Atomic classes

There are five so called atomic classes. Atomic classes
are the most basic classes on which most high-level objects
are based on. These are:

* **double:**    `-0.5`, `120.9`, `5.0`
* **integer:**   `-1`, `121`, `5`
* **logical:**   `TRUE` and `FALSE`
* **character:** `"Reto"`, `"Innsbruck"`, `"5"`
* **complex:**   `-5+11i`, `3+2i`, `0+4i`

You can always check the class of an object by calling `class`:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# numeric
x <- 1
class(x)
```

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# character
y <- "This is just a dummy text"
class(y)
```

### Know the basics!

It is fundamental to understand the basic objects or data
types of _R_ (same for other programming languages).
More complex objects are based on these basic data types.
Once you have understood the basics it makes it _much easier_
to understand objects of increasing complexity.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/02/02_datatypes_3.png"></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/02/02_datatypes_4.png"></div>

Thus, **knowing the basics** is **essential**
to get a good programmer.


## Input and Output

This is just a very brief repetition from the last session.
In _R_, values are assigned to objects (input) using either
`=` or `<-`. The latter one is the preferred way in _R_.
As an example: if we want to store the number `5` on
a variable called `a` we will write `a <- 5`. This is read
as "_a gets five_", you can think of it as an arrow assigning
`5` to `a`.

An assignment always requires a left and a right hand side,
just as in mathematics (`a = 5`).
```{r, eval = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
x = 2
x <- 2 # preferred in R
```

Comments in _R_ can be written everywhere using the `#` character.
Everything behind `#` will be ignored by _R_ (a comment is not
a command, but an explanation or note for those reading your code.

```{r, eval = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
# Everything behind '#' is ignored (just a comment)
# Comments are not executed: y <- 100
x <- 5  # Can also be at the end of the line
```


**Keep in mind that code is more often read than written!** Well
written comments will make it much easier for you to understand
what you did and why you did it (believe me, you will forget it)
but also for others checking, using or adapting your code.
Some people say a good code-to-comment ratio is 60 percent comments,
40 percent code.
When typing commands into _R_ console without assigning the value(s) to
an object _R_ prints the values (output), also known as implicit printing.
Two examples:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
50
"A useless character string"
```


We can also _explicitly_ call the `print` function. The result
is the very same. Note: _implicit printing_ is only used when you
are working on an interactive _R_ console (as in your IDE).
When calling _R_ as a batch job you have to do explicit printing.
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
print(50)
print("A useless character string")
```

On an interactive _R_ command line we can also use both,
implicit and explicit printing, when we want to print the
current values of an object. 
In this example we store a character string as `y` and print
it to examine `y`s current content/values:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
y <- "A useless character string"
print(y)
```


## Atomic Classes

### Double

One atomic data class are doubles (double precision floating
point values). Double is actually not often used in _R_, objects
of type double are simply called `numeric` and the class of
floating point numbers will be `numeric`.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# define a double (numeric)
x <- 1.5
x
# another one
x <- 10
x
class(x)
```

### Integers

A second atomic class are integers.
Integers can explicitly be defined using the
so called `L` suffix. While `1` will be numeric,
`1L` will e integer.
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# define an integer value
x <- 10L
x
class(x)
```

This is not important most of the time when you are
using _R_. Except when it is! There are some situations
where integers are required!
### Logical values

Logicals are rather simple as they can only take
up two different values: either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# logical "true"
x <- TRUE
x
# logical "false"
x <- FALSE
x
class(x)
```

### Characters

The last atomic class we will is the character class.
A character is basically just a text and can be of any length.
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# define character string
x <- "Austria"
x
# can be of an arbitrary length
x <- "Max Konstantin Mustermann (AT)"
x
class(x)
```

### Checking classes

We can check if an object is of a specific class
in several different ways. One handy way are the
`is.*` commands. `is.character("foo")` will return
logical `TRUE` if `"foo"` is a character object
and `FALSE` else. Functions for all base objects
exist such as:

* `is.double`
* `is.integer`
* `is.logical`
* `is.character`
* ... and many more.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
is.integer(1.5)
is.double(1.5)
is.logical(FALSE)
```


# Vectors

So far we have always only assigned one element to a variable,
e.g., `x <- 5`. To assign more than only one single element to
an object vectors can be used. A vector is basically just a sequence
of elements. **Note:** vectors can only take up elements of the same
class! A character vector can only contain characters, a numeric vector
only numerics, and so on.

We can define vectors in different ways. One option is to create
new vectors by calling the `vector` function. The function takes
two input values: the class of the vector we would like to get
(`"character"`, `"numeric"`, `"logical"`, `"integer"`) and an integer
which specifies how long the vector should be. In the example
below two vectors are created: an numeric or double vector of length `5`,
and a character vector of length 3.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Numeric vector of length 5
vector("double", length = 5)
# Character vector of length 3
vector("character", length = 3)
```

As you can see both vectors are empty. The default value of numeric
vectors is `0`, the default for character vectors is `""` (just
an empty character string, a text without any characters in it).
More frequently we will use the `c` function (for combine values or
concatenate). `c(...)` is a function which takes up multiple values
separated by a comma. For example:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Numeric vector with
# five explicit values
c(5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
# Character vector
c("Innsbruck", "Austria")
```

The `c(5, 4, 3, 2, 1)` creates a vector of length `5` containing
`5`, `4`, ..., `1` in this order. As all elements we insert are
numeric, the resulting vector will be a numeric vector. In the
line below two characters (`"Innsbruck"`, `"Austria"`) are combined
to a vector. Thus, the result will be a character vector of length `2`.
We could, of course, repeat this example for all atomic
classes like including doubles (numeric), logical, character,
integer, and complex values:
```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
x <- c(0.5, 0.6, 0.7)            # double
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)        # logical
x <- c(T, F, T)                  # logical
x <- c("a", "b", "c")            # character
x <- c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L)           # integer
x <- 15:20                       # integer
x <- c(1+0i, 2+4i, 5+2i)         # complex
```

**Warning:** The example above shows that you could also
use `T` and `F` as an abbreviation for `TRUE` and `FALSE`.
**Please don't do that!** `T` and `F` are not protected and
can be changed. Below we re-define or overwrite `T` with
`"bar"` and `F` with `"FOO"`. Thus, `c(T, T, F, T)` becomes
something completely different. **Even more mean:** Imagine
what happens if I re-define `T <- FALSE` and `F <- TRUE`.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
c(T, T, F, T)
```

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
T <- "foo"        # overwrite T
F <- "bar"        # overwrite F
c(T, T, F, T)
```

Thus, please get used to `TRUE` and `FALSE` from the beginnign
on. `T` and `F` is shorter, but you might run into strange 
problems at some point which can be avoided by just not
using these abbreviations.

## Create Vectors

We can also create vectors using different functions. Here we will
have a closer look to `seq`/`seq.int` (sequence) and `rep` (repeat).

**Sequences:** sequences are a set of numeric or integer values
between two well defined points (`from` and `to`) with an equidistant
spacing. By default the spacing/increment is `1` but can be explicitly
specified using the `by` argument.

**Repeat:** Repeat allows to repeat a number (or a set of number)
in different ways. We can repeat one element several times, repeat
a vector multiple times, or repeat the elements of a vector
multiple times.

Some examples for numeric sequences:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Equidistant sequence
seq(from = 1.5, to = 2.5, length = 5)
# Repeat `1` five times
rep(1.0, 5)
# Repat `1` and `2`, each twice
rep(c(1, 2), each = 2)
# Repeat `7` three times, `6` once
rep(c(7, 6), c(3, 1))
```

For integer sequences, the repeat function can be used as for
numeric values (and all others), however, some things are
slightly different for integers. To create an integer sequence
with an increment of `1` we can call `<from>:<to>`, e.g.,
`50:55` creates an integer sequence between `50` and `55`
(can also be used to create decreasing sequences).
A `seq.int` function also exists to create integer sequences.
`seq.int` returns an integer sequence if and only if the
`from` argument can be interpreted as integer. For example:
`seq.int(from = 5, ...)` returns an integer sequence, so does
`seq.int(from = 5.0, ...)`. However, if `from` is no integer
(e.g., `seq.int(from = 5.5, ...)`, or the interval is no
integer (e.g., `seq.int(..., by = 0.5)` a numeric sequence will
be returned and `seq.int` acts like `seq`.

Some examples:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Integer from 50 to 55
50:55
# Reverse
55:50
# Sequence
seq.int(from = 5, to = 12, by = 2)
# Repeat `1L` five times
rep(1L, 5)
```

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Repeat `TRUE` 5 times
rep(TRUE, 5)
# Repeat `TRUE`/`FALSE` twice
rep(c(TRUE, FALSE), each = 2)
# Repeat 3 x `FALSE`, 1 x `TRUE`
rep(c(FALSE, TRUE), c(3, 1))
```

... and characters. Convenient for characters: _R_ has
two objects you can use called `LETTERS` and `letters`.
`LETTERS` contains the alphabet (no special characters)
in upper case letters (`"A"`, `"B"`, ...), `letters` the
same in lower case letters (`"a"`, `"b"`, ...). This can
be used if one just wants to have some random character
values.
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Repeat `"A"` seven times
rep("A", 7)
# First 7 letters of the alphabet
LETTERS[1:7]
letters[1:7]
```


## Vectors

As mentioned in the first part of this section:
vectors **can only contain elements of one type!**
What happens if we try to mix elements of different
classes, e.g., a numeric and a character?
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Numeric and character = character
x <- c(1.7, "A")
class(x)
x
```

The class of `x` is `character`. Reason: `1.7` can be
converted into `character`, `"A"` cannot be converted
to a numeric value. Thus, _R_ converts the numeric
value to character (note that `"1.7"` is now a character
string which contains the 'word' `"1.7"` and not a number anymore).
Similar when mixing `logical` and `numeric` values.
The result is `numeric`. Note: we could also convert
`6.2` to `logical`, but all numbers not equal to `0` will be converted
to `TRUE`, and `0` will be converted to `FALSE`. Thus, if we would
convert from `numeric` to `integer` we would lose much more information
as when converting from `logical` to `integer`, that's why _R_ does
it this way around. Example:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Logical and numeric = numeric
x <- c(TRUE, 6.2)
class(x)
x
```

Converting values between different data types (atomic classes)
is called coercion, in this case implicit coercion as we did
not tell _R_ to do so, but to be able to create our object
_R_ has to do it.
We can, of course, also use explicit coercion. The `as.*` functions
allow us to explicitly convert values between different classes.
E.g., `as.character(1.42)` will convert the numeric value `1.42`
into a character. A wide range of different `as.*` functions
exists such as:

* `as.integer`
* `as.numeric`
* `as.character`
* `as.logical`
* `as.matrix`
Let us create a new integer vector between `0` and `4`,
assign it to `x`, and convert this integer vector to
logical:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# let `x` be an integer vector
# with elements 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
x <- 0:4
x
```

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Coerce to character
as.character(x)
# Coerce to logical
as.logical(x)
```

As mentioned previously: all numeric values `0` will
converted to `0`, all others (including negative values)
to `TRUE`.
Even if we use explicit coercion it is sometimes not
possible to convert from one class to another.
Characters from the alphabet, such as `"a"` or `"b"`
cannot be converted. Characters which are basically
only characters containing a numeric value (`"100"`, `"135.3"`)
can be coerced.

If _R_ is not able to convert elements, it will return
`NA` (and throw a warning):
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# let `x` be a character vector
x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
x
# Coerce to integer
as.integer(x)
# But ...
x <- c("1", "100", "a", "b", "33")
as.integer(x)
```

## Missing values

So far we have not been talking about missing values. _R_ knows
two types of missing values: `NaN` and `NA`.
`NaN` is "not a number" and results from mathematical operations
which are illegal/invalid. One classical example is if we try
to divide `0` by `0`.
`NA` is Rs "missing value" element.

* `NaN`: mathematically not defined (and always of class `numeric`)
* `NA`: missing value, \code{NA}'s still have classes!
* `NaN` is also `NA` but not vice versa

Examples:

```{r}
# 0/0 is invalid
x <- 0/0
class(x)
is.nan(x)
is.na(x)
```
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
x <- 0/0
x
```


If you just assign `NA` to an object (`x <- NA`) the class of
`x` will be `numeric` by default. However, for demonstration
purposes let us convert a missing value into `character` and
`integer` using the coercion functions:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# numeric/logical NA
x <- as.numeric(NA)
y <- as.logical(NA)
x
class(x)
y
class(y)
```

As you can both `x` and `y` look identical (both just contain
one single `NA` element), however, `x` is of class `character`
while `y` is of class `integer`.

## Coercion

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
fn <- function() {
    options(warn = -1); on.exit(options(warn = 1))
    cmd <- c("as.numeric", "as.integer", "as.logical", "as.character")
    val <- list(2.9, 0.0, 4L, 0L, TRUE, FALSE, "A", "TRUE", "FALSE", "NA")
    res <- list()
    for(i in seq_along(val)) {
        res[[i]] <- lapply(cmd, function(x, v) do.call(x,list(x=v)), v = val[i])
        res[[i]] <- lapply(res[[i]], function(x) ifelse(is.na(x), "NA", x))
        # Characters
        idx <- grep("as.character", cmd)
        if(length(idx) > 0)
            res[[i]][[idx]] <- sprintf("\"%s\"", res[[i]][[idx]])
    }
    return(res)
}
res <- fn()
```


## Attributes

Objects in _R_ can also have attributes. Attributes can be seen as
class specific meta information. Vectors have, by default, a length
(number of elements in the vector) and can, optionally, have names.
Matrices have attributes which specify the dimension of the matrix
and (optional) names for the columns and rows.

## Vector Attributes

We can get the length of a vector by calling the `length` function,
and all other attributes by calling `attributes`.
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Basic numeric vector
x <- c(28, 1.82)
x
length(x)
attributes(x)
```

As you can see the vector above (`x <- c(28, 1.82)`) has
no additional attributes. We can, however, define a vector
with names:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# A vector with names
y <- c(age = 54, size = 1.82)
y
length(y)
attributes(y) # See also `names(y)`
```

Note that the names (`age` and `size`) are not part of the
values stored in the vector. The vector still contains the
two numeric values `54` and `1.82`, however, we can now
use the names to access the data.

## Vector Subsetting

Accessing specific elements of a vector (or an object in general)
is called subsetting. For vectors this can be done in several ways:

* by index (position in the vector)
* based on logical vectors
* by name (if defined)

### Subsetting by indizes

We can access elements by simply specifying the
index of the element we would like to get. Subsetting
can be done using the squared brackets `[...]`
while function calls use round brackets (e.g., `mean(...)`).
We can simply pick the first or fifth element of a vector
`x` by calling `x[1]` or `x[5]`. _R_ will return element `1`/`5` out
of `x`.  If we need the first _and_ the fifth we can also
ask for `x[c(1, 5)]`:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
x <- c(10, 20, 0, 30, 50)
x
# Get first and/or fifth element
x[1]
x[5]
x[c(1, 5)]
```

We can also do it the other way around:
`x[-1]` gives us all elements of `x` **except** the first one.
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
x[-1]
x[-5]
x[-c(1, 5)]
```

Using indizes we can also take the first four elements ...
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# First four elements
x <- 1:10
x[1:4]
```

... or the last four elements of a vector.
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Last four elements
x[7:10]
```

_R_ provides two convenient functions called
`head` and `tail` to get the
first `n` entries (default is `n = 6`) and the
last `n` entries which works on most objects (not
only vectors!):
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# First four elements
x <- 1:10
head(x, n = 4)
```

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Last four elements
tail(x, n = 4)
```

### Subsetting by name

If we have a vector with names, here a vector with three
elements named `age`, `height`, and `zipcode` we can also
access vector elements by name.
Instead of using a numeric index (`x[1]`) we use a character
string to specify the element we would like to get returned.
**Note** that this has to be a character string. Thus, we
have to call `x["age"]` (with quotes). `x[age]` does **not work**
as _R_ would try to find an object or variable `age` which does
not exist. If two elements are needed we can, again, also use
a vector (in this case a character vector) to get both,
the `"age"` and `"height"`:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
x <- c(age = 28, height = 1.82,
       zipcode = 6020)
x["age"]     # age (note "")
x["height"]  # height (note "")
x[c("age", "height")]
```

In contrast to index subsetting `x[-"age"]` does not work.
You cannot get "all elements except age" like it worked for
index subsetting.

### Subsetting by logical vectors

An alternatively we can use a `logical` vector to subset
vectors. Remember: `logical` vectors contain either `TRUE`
or `FALSE`. In the context of subsetting it can be used to
get all elements where the logical vector contains `TRUE`.
An example:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
x <- c(10, 20, 0, 30, 50)
x[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)]
```

As you can see we only get the first two elements, as only the
first two elements of the logical vector contain `TRUE`s.
This is what happens if we use logical operators to subset
a data frame. Let's assume that we are interested in getting
all elements of `x` which are larger than `25` (`x > 25`, see `?Comparison`
for more information):
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Find all values x > 25
x > 25
# Returns logical vector, thus:
x[x > 25]
```

What happens is: `x > 25` returns a logical vector of
the same length as `x` (try `x > 25` on the console).
`x[x > 25]` is thus called with a logical vector and
we will get all values `x` where `x > 25` (where 
`x > 25 == TRUE`.

In some situations we might not only be interested in
getting all values of `x` which fulfill a specific condition,
we may also want to know where these elements are located
in the vector `x` (we will get the index, not the value).
This can be done using `which`. `which(...)` returns the
index of all `TRUE`s.
`which(c(FALSE, TRUE))` will thus return `2` as only the
second element is `TRUE`. We can use this to, for example,
find the position of all elements `x` which are `30`
(`x == 30`, see `?Comparison`):
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Logical vector where x == 30
y <- x == 30
y
# Find index where x == 30
idx <- which(y == TRUE) 
idx
# Get elements
x[idx]
```

Or with some fewer lines of code (more compact):
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Same vector
x <- c(10, 20, 0, 30, 50)
# Get all x == 30
x[x == 30]
# Opposite
x[!x == 30]
x[x != 30]
x[x >= 20 & x < 35]
```

Logical operators can also be used to find, e.g.,
the position of the maximum within a vector.
`which(x == max(x))` returns us the index of the
element in `x` which is equal to the maximum of
`x`. Thus `x[which(x == max(x))]` will be the very
same as `max(x)`. There are two functions to 
get the index of the maximum/minimum element of
`x` called `which.min` and `which.max`:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Using which
which(x == max(x))
# Special functions:
which.min(x)
which.max(x)
```

* `which.min(x)` is equivalent to `which(x == min(x))`
* `which.max(x)` is equivalent to `which(x == max(x))`


## Relational and Logical Operators

### Rational Operators

We have already used some rational operators to check
for values larger, smaller, or equal to a number or character.
The full list of rational operators (see also `?Comparison` and `?Logic`):

* `x < y`:  where `x` smaller than `y`
* `x > y`:  where `x` larger than `y`
* `x <= y`: where `x` smaller or equal `y` 
* `x >= y`: where `x` larger or equal `y`
* `x == y`: where `x` equals `y`
* `x != y`: where `x` is not equal to `y`
* `!`:      negation (NOT; `! x == 20`)
* `\&`:     logical "and" (`x >= 20 \& x < 35`)
* `|`:      logical "or" (`x == 20 | x > 45`)
* `xor`:    logical "exclusive or'' (`xor(x == 20, x == 50)`)
* `x \%in\% y`:    where `x` in `y` (value matching; character)
* `! x \%in\% y`:  where `x` not in `y` (value matching; character)

Note that there is also `&&`, `||` and `isTRUE` but these are
_no element wise operations_, ignore them for now.


## Practical Session

For those who want to practice a bit, try to create
the following vectors using `rep`, `seq` or other methods/ways
we have learned this time:

**Number 1:**

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
# Number 1
-5:5
```

**Number 2:**

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
seq(from = 11, to = 7, by = -0.5)
```

**Number 3:**

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
rep(c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE), c(3,3,1,3))
```


**Number 4:** Create a sequence between `-5` and `5` with an interval of `0.1`.


**Number 5:** Create a sequence between `100` and `150` with a length of `17`.
