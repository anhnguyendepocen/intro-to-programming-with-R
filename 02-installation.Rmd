# Installation

Installation from source is also possible for numerous (and also exotic)
platforms. Manual compilation is easy when the required compilers are already
ship with the operating system (e.g., Unix/Linux) in the usual configure/make/install
steps. Compilers are also available for MS Windows but might
require some more installation/configuration. Thus, this is not recommended if
not really needed.

## Interfaces and Development Environments (IDE)

The basic _R_ installation comes with a command line interface (CLI), possibly
enhanced by some limited graphical user interface (GUI) capabilities on 
Windows and Mac. The CLI is basically all you need, and if you are a
command line enthusiast you can basically stop here :).

For all others: various so called integrated development environments (IDEs)
exist (e.g., _R_ commander, RStudio, and others). IDEs typically provide
interactive command line access (CLI), but also an editor where we will
develop code and additional features (such as package and source file
management, access to help pages, ...).

One popular IDE for _R_ is [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/).
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) is free to use and open
source (but developed and maintained by a private company) and is available
for all operating systems (MS Windows, Mac OS X, Linux). To install visit
[https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
and download the free RStudio Desktop version which fits your operating
system. For linux users: RStudio is typically also available via package
manager (`apt`, `yum`, ...). Ater installation and starting RStudio
you should see the following IDE:

The interface consists of an editor (top left), the _R_ command line (bottom left),
a summary of your current workspace (might be empty; shows all objects defined
in the current _R_ session; top right) and access to plots, help pages, and
packages (bottom right).

We will use RStudio during this course, however, feel free to use the pure CLI
(there are also plugins to text editors such as `vim`/`neovim`) if you are
more efficient when not using an IDE.

## Interactive Examples

For today we will only try out some basic examples to understand
the IDE, we will learn all the details about _R_'s data types,
plot and data I/O functions over the next weeks. Don't worry
if you don't know in detail what's going on!

**For these small interactive examples you will only need the
R console** (bottom left panel of RStudio). You could, of course,
write a script and execute it from the script, however, this is
not needed.
Thus **just try to go trough the small exercises below by typing
in the commands to the R console**.

### R as a basic calculator

_R_ can be used as an advanced calculator. As a first example
let's find out what `5` to the power of `2` is. It is obviously
`25`, but let's try to solve it with _R_.
To do so we create a variable called `a` and assign the numeric
value `5` to it:

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
# Define a new variable `a` and set `a` to 5
a  = 5
a <- 5 # preferred way

# Show if it worked
print(a)

# A to the power of `2` in different ways
a * a
a**2
a^2
```

Let's assume you don't only have to compute $5^2$ but for a set or
sequence of numbers. A sequence of numbers is a vector. E.g.,
`c(1, 2, 3)` is a vector which contains three different numeric
values, `1`, `2`, and `3`.
Let's first specify a new variable, I've called it `b`, which should
contain a set of numbers between `0` and `10`. In _R_ we can use
the function `seq(...)` which returns us a **sequence** of values
between two limits (from ... to).
```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.show = "hide", fig.align = "center"}
# Define a sequence from 0 to 10
b <- seq(from = 0, to = 10)
print(b)
```

We could now take each element to the power of two (let's say
calculate $0^2$, $1^2$, ... element by element which, at least by hand,
will take quite some time. 
In _R_ (as in other programming languages) we can also perform this
calculation on a vector which solves it element-wise.
Thus, `b^2` will take each element of `b` to the power of `2`.
```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.show = "hide", fig.align = "center"}
# b to the power of 2
b^2
```

_R_ also provides a wide range of plotting function. We can
use `plot(...)` to visualize how `b^2` looks like by doing
something as follows:
```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.show = "hide", fig.align = "center"}
# Plot b versus b^2
plot(b, b^2)
lines(b, b^2, lty = 2)
# Adding b versus b (linear)
lines(b, b, col = "red")
```

Another important feature of all programming languages is data import
and export. I've put a small CVS (comma-separated values) file on
OLAT which contains the names and the height of some persons.

**Download the csv file** from OLAT and **import the data set**
using the `read.csv(...)` function (see below).
`read.csv(...)` returns the content of the file (`"height.csv"`)
if it is able to read the file. If the file is not a CSV file,
contains strange things, or is just not well formatted, 
`read.csv` will quite likely drop an error and stop.

In our case the CSV file should be well-formatted and `read.csv` should
return the data set. We directly assign the data set read from the file
to a new variable called `data`. After the import, the data set will
be stored on `data` and we can use it for our further explorative data
analysis. `data.frame`s are somehow similar to XLS tables, a matrix-style
data type which consists of rows and columns. Variables are stored in
columns, in this case the `name` of the person and the `height` of the
person, very similar to "_column A, column B, ..." in Excel.
The rows (23 rows in this example) contain the different persons/individuals
and are (in this case) numbered from `1` to `23`, just like in Excel.

In `data.frames` we can easily access the different columns of the data
set using the `$` operator. `data$name` tells _R_ that we would like
to have the data/content of the colum,n `name` from our data set stored
on the variable `data`. The same yields, of course, for `data$height`.
This allows us to easily calculate the mean height of all our individuals
by calling `mean(data$height)`.
```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.show = "hide", fig.align = "center"}
data <- read.csv("height.csv")    # Reading CSV data set
head(data, n = 3)                 # First three lines of the data set
class(data)                       # 'data' is a 'data.frame' object.
mean(data$height)
```

Try to use the `min` and `max` function to see how large the
talles and shortest ones are. Also try to call `summary`
on the whole `data.frame`/`object` or on one specific column.
Just for having some fun: let's try to use different plotting
methods to visualize the data set.

* `plot(...)` to plot the height
* `hist(...)` to get a histogram of the height of the individuals
* `barplot(...)` to get a barplot. With the names. Hint: you will
   need something like `barplot(..., names.arg = ...)`.

In _R_ you can always get help by calling `?<function>`, e.g.,
`?plot` or `?hist`. Try to find some help there if something is
not working or to find out which options the different functions
provide. For example: changing plot style, adding color, add
title and labels, and many more.
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig = TRUE, width = 12, height = 3, fig.align = "center"}
par(mfrow = c(1,3))
plot(data$height, pch = 19)
hist(data$height)
barplot(data$height, names.arg = data$name, las = 2)
```
