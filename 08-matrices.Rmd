# Matrices

In one of the first sessions I've shown the following image
which explains how the different objects are connected to
each other and/or based on each other. So far, we have 
learned a lot about (atomic) vectors, one of the basic 
objects in _R_. In this session we will see how matrices,
data frames, and lists work.

<div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="images/06/06_datatypes_3.png">
</div>

As shown, matrices are based on vectors, while data frames
are based on lists, another frequently used object type in _R_. 

But let's start with matrices first!

## Matrices in _R_

* matrices are **based on vectors**
* can only contain data of **one class** (or mode; as vectors)
* have a **dimension** attribute (`dim`)
* **can have** row and column **names** (`rownames`, `colnames`)

Matrices can be created using the `matrix` function (see `?matrix` or `help("matrix")`.
According to the _R_ documentation the usage of the `matrix` function is as follows:

```
matrix(data = NA, nrow = 1, ncol = 1, byrow = FALSE, dimnames = NULL)
```
* `data`: a data vector (default `NA`)
* `nrow`: integer, number of rows (default `1`)
* `ncol`: integer, number of columns (default `1`)
* `byrow`: logical, whether or not to fill by row (default by column)
* `dimnames`: optional list of length 2 with rownames and column names.

**Function defaults:** functions can have required inputs (as seen in 
the lecture), but also optional input arguments with defaults. If an
input has a default (e.g., `data = NA`) the default value as defined
is used if we do not define this input. Thus, the call
`matrix()` will create a matrix containing `NA` (`data = NA`)
with one row (`nrow = 1`) and one column (`ncol = 1`).

**Generic methods for matrices**

For matrices (and most other objects) a set of so called
generic methods or functions exist. Some useful methods
for matrices are:

* `head(x, n = N)`: show first $N$ rows
* `tail(x, n = N)`: show last $N$ rows
* `summary(x)`: object summary
* `rbind(x1, x2)`: row-bind two matrices
* `cbind(x1, x2)`: column-bind and column-bind
* `subset`: subsetting a matrix
* ... and many others ...

Note that these are generic methods and they will also
work on other objects (e.g., vectors or data frames).

## Create a matrix

The following examples show how to create matrices of different
dimensions with and without data.
To create a matrix of the dimension $2 \times 3$ without data
we can call:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# NA matrix, dimension 2x3
matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
```

Remember that the default for the input `data` is `NA`. As we
have not specified `data` the whole matrix will be filled with
missing values. The two additional arguments define the matrix
size with two rows and three columns ($2 \times 3$ matrix).

Instead of creating an empty matrix we can also directly provide
data. In this case, an integer sequence `1:9` is used.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Matrix containing 1-9 (3x3)
matrix(data = 1:9, nrow = 3)
```

**Note:** we do not provide the `ncol` argument. Our data set is
of length 9 (`length(1:9)`) and we are asking for three rows.
There is only one way to fulfil the requirements: creating a
$3 \times 3$ matrix.
A graphical representation of what is happening is shown below:
<div style="text-align: center; padding: 20px 0;">
  <img src="images/06/06_vector_to_matrix.png" style="width: 60%;">
</div>

The upper part of the image represents a vector, e.g., the vector
of length 9 shown in the example (`1:9`). The bottom figure shows
how the vector is represented in the matrix, a $3 \times 3$ matrix
in this example. By default **the data is filled by column, wherefore
the first (left) column will contain the values `1`, `2`, `3`, the
next column `4`, `5`, `6`, and the last column the remaining values
`7`, `8`, `9`. We can change this behavior ...

## Fill by row/column

The `matrix` by default uses `byrow = FALSE` and fills in the
data by column (as shown above). However, we can set `byrow = TRUE`
to fill in the data by row (top row first).
The following two chunks show the effect:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# byrow = FALSE (default)
x <- matrix(data = 1:9, ncol = 3,
            byrow = FALSE)
# Print the object
print(x)
```

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# byrow = TRUE
x <- matrix(data = 1:9, ncol = 3,
            byrow = TRUE)
# Print the object
print(x)
```

## Column-binding and row-binding (vectors)

Another way to create matrices in _R_ is to row-bind or
column-bind vectors. This is very useful if you do have a set
of vectors and you want to combine or store them in one matrix
object.

Imagine we have two numeric vectors `x` and `y` of length
3 and we want to create a matrix which contains
`x` in the first column and `y` in the second column.
To do so, we can simply call the `cbind` function.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Two numeric vectors
x <- c(5, 5, 5)
y <- c(11, 22, 33)
# column-binding
z <- cbind(x, y)
```

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
class(z)
print(z)
```

The result of `cbind(x, y)` is a $3 \times 2$ matrix. `cbind`
can also be used to combine more than two vectors **but note**
that not all combinations of lengths are allowed (well, _R_
tries to recycle the vectors to match the length of the longest
vector and will warn you if this is not possible. Try it out!).

**Column names:** note that, in case of `cbind` and also `rbind`
_R_ automatically uses the names of the vectors (here `x` and `y`)
as row or column name. We will learn how to access and specify
row names and column names later in this document.

The counterpart of `cbind` is `rbind` which works the very same,
but combines the vectors row-wise and not column-wise.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Two numeric vectors
x <- c(5, 5, 5)
y <- c(11, 22, 33)
# column-binding
z <- rbind(x, y)
class(z)
print(z)
```

## Column-binding and row-binding (matrices)

`cbind` and `rbind` can also be used to combine matrices.
Again, you have to take care of the dimensions of the matrices.
However, let's assume we have two matrices of the very same
dimension (both, `x1` and `x2` are $3 \times 2$ matrices).
Row-binding and column-binding of matrices works just the same
as for vectors:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Two matrices
x1 <- matrix(1:6,     ncol = 2)
x2 <- matrix(101:106, ncol = 2)
# column-binding
cbind(x1, x2)
```

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Two matrices
x1 <- matrix(1:6,     ncol = 2)
x2 <- matrix(101:106, ncol = 2)
# column-binding
rbind(x1, x2)
```

... except that no automatic row/column names are set. 
If `x1` and/or `x2` would have had row and/or column names
they would have been kept, of course.

## Matrix attributes

As we now know how to create simple matrices let's check
the attributes. Remember:  matrices are "just" vectors with
additional attributes! While a vector only has a `class` and
a certain `length`, matrices come with an additional dimension
attribute.

The function `dim` returns the dimension of the matrix, an
integer vector of length $2$ where the first element corresponds
to the number of rows (always rows first), the second element
corresponds to the number of column.s

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
x <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 4)
x # Show matrix
dim(x) # Matrix dimension
```

As we all know how 'vector subsetting by index' works we 
can now easily pick the number of rows and columns using:

* `dim(x)[1L]}: number of rows,
* `dim(x)[2L]}: number of columns.

... or use `nrow` and `ncol`, two convenient functions
to either get the number of rows or columns.
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
nrow(x)      # Number of rows
ncol(x)      # Number of columns
length(x)    # Length
class(x)     # Class
is.matrix(x) # Check if is matrix
```

**Note:** a matrix also always has a length! This length
corresponds to the underlying vector. A $3 \times 3$ matrix
is of length 9 (has 9 elements), a $5 \times 5$ matrix
is of length 25 and so far and so on.

As for all objects we can retrieve the class of the object
by calling the `class` function, and use `is.matrix` to check
whether or not a certain object is of class `matrix` or not
(returns `TRUE` or `FALSE`).

## Setting dimension names (\code{rownames}, \code{colnames})

Another important attribute of a matrix are the dimension names,
or row names and column names (in case of two-dimensional matrices).

They can be accessed and specified using the `rownames` and
`colnames` functions.
Let us create a $3 \times 3$ matrix ...
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Same matrix again
x <- matrix(data = 1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
```

... and set row and column names using character vectors.
As our matrix `x` has three rows and three columns, we do
have to provide three row names and three column names.
Note that the naming here is not very useful but demonstrates
how they can be defined:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
rownames(x) <- c("Row 1", "Row 2", "Row 3")
colnames(x) <- c("Col A", "Col B", "Col C")
```

If we print the matrix `x` again we can see that all our
rows and columns are now labeled.
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
print(x)
```

`rownames` and `colnames` cannot only be used to **set**
the names but also to **get** the names from an existing
object:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
rownames(x)
colnames(x)
dim(x)
```

**Additional hint:** we don't always have to set all
row names and column names, we could also only set or
change one specific element by e.g.,
calling `rownames(x)[1L] <- "Fooo"` to overwrite the
rowname of the first row (`1L`) with `"Fooo"`.

## Set dimension names when creating the object

Another way is to directly specify the dimension names
when calling the `matrix` function. The function takes
up an optional input `dimnames` (by default this is set to `NULL`).
We can specify a list containing two character vectors
(`dimnames = list(<rownames>, <colnames>)`)  where the
first vector contains the row names, the second one the
column names:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Create matrix with dimension names
x <- matrix(data = 1:9, ncol = 3,
            dimnames = list(c("Row 1", "Row 2", "Row 3"),
                            c("Col A", "Col B", "Col C")))
# Print the object
print(x)
```

... to get the very same result as in the section above.

## Practical Exercises (part 1)

Note that there are no solutions in this file, there's an
extra file on OLAT with a detailed solution to the following
short exercises.
### Practical exercise 1

Create the following matrices using `matrix(...)`:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
x <- matrix(NA, ncol = 2, nrow = 2)
print(x)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
x <- matrix(1:15, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)
print(x)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
z <- matrix(rep(c(1,2,3), each = 5), ncol = 3)
rownames(z) <- sprintf("row_%d", 1:5)
colnames(z) <- c("A", "B", "C")
print(z)
```

Furthermore, check attributes, length, dimension.

### Practical exercise 2

Create the following matrices based on
three (logical/numeric) vectors (`A`/`B`/`C`;`X1`/`X2`/`X3`)
and row and/or column bind:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
A <- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)
B <- c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
C <- c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
print(cbind(A, B, C))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
A <- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)
B <- c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
C <- c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
print(rbind(A, B, C))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
X1 <- c(1.1, 2.2)
X2 <- c(100, 200)
X3 <- c(-500, 500)
print(cbind(X1, X2, X3))
```

Furthermore, check attributes, length, dimension.

## Subsetting matrices

Subsetting matrices is similar to subsetting vectors except
that we can subset by row and/or column. As for vectors we can:

* subsetting **by index**
* subsetting **by name** (if set)
* typically (not necessarily) two-dimensional!

When using row and column indizes it is again _rows first_,
_columns second_. The following image shows the indexing
of a matrix. The blue numbers correspond to the row index
(thus always `1` for the top row, `2` for the second row, ...),
the red numbers the index of the columns (`1`s left, `2` middle, ...).

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="images/06/06_matrix.png" style="width: 40%">
</div>

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
x <- matrix(1:12 + 100,
            nrow = 4,
            dimnames = list(c("Row 1", "Row 2", "Row 3", "Row 4"),
                            c("Col A", "Col B", "Col C")))
```

Imagine we do have the following matrix:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
x # Demo matrix
```

Using subsetting by index we can now access specific
elements by calling:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
x[3, 2]
x[1, 3]
```

The first call picks the element in the **third row** and **second column**,
the second call the element in **row 1** and **column three**.

What happens if we use one single value instead of two
(one for the rows, one for the columns) as above?
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
x[10]   # What happens here?
```

Well, a matrix is built on a vector. `x[10L]` gives us the
tenth element of the vector! As matrices are filled by column
(!even if you specify `byrow = TRUE`; that just stores the
data in a different order) the tenth element of our $4 times 3$
matrix is `x[3, 2]`.

You can number them (top down, starting top left). The first
column contains the elements `1L`, `2L`, `3L`, `4L`, the second
column the elements `5L` to `8L`, the third column starts with
`9L` followed by the one we are interested in, `x[10L]`
(the element `x[2, 3]`).

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
print(x)
```

Instead of picking single elements of the matrix we can also
subset specific rows or columns. We can do this by leaving
one index empty (empty means "all"). E.g. `x[3, ]` means
"_give me the third row, all columns_":
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Subsetting 3th row
x[3, ]
class(x[3, ])
length(x[3, ])
dim(x[3, ]) # Is a vector!
```

Note that, by default, _R_ returns us a **vector** if we
subset one specific row or column! The result is no longer
a matrix.

The counterpart to row-subsetting is column-subsetting which
works the very same way:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Subsetting 3th column
x[, 3]
class(x[, 3])
length(x[, 3])
dim(x[, 3]) # Is a vector!
```

If you do algebra with _R_ you may need a row or column
vector:

* Column vector: `matrix` with only one column (an $N \times 1$ matrix)
* Row vector: `matrix` with only one row (an $1 \times N$ matrix)

This can be achieved by setting the `drop = FALSE` argument.
If `drop = FALSE` is set _R_ does not drop the matrix
attributes (i.e., row names, column names, dimension, class)
and the result will be of class `matrix`:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Row vector
x[3, , drop = FALSE]
class(x[3, , drop = FALSE])
# Column vector
x[, 3, drop = FALSE]
class(x[, 3, drop = FALSE])
```

We can, of course, also combine row and column subsetting.
The following calls:

* extract the **second and third row** (`c(2, 3)`), but only
     the **first column** (`1`).
* extract the **fourth row**, but only the **first and second column**
     (`c(1,2)`).

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
x # Our matrix
# 2nd and 3th row, 1th column
x[c(2, 3), 1]
# 4th row, 1th and 2nd column
x[4, c(1, 2)]
```

Again, if the result contains only one row or only 
one column _R_ drops the matrix attributes and simplifies
the result to a vector. To avoid that, we can set `drop = FALSE` again:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# 2nd and 3th row, 1th column
x[c(2, 3), 1, drop = FALSE]
# 4th row, 1th and 2nd column
x[4, c(1, 2), drop = FALSE]
```

## Subsetting matrices with logical vectors

We can also subset matrices with logical vectors.
This is used for subsetting with logics. When using
logical vectors, these vectors have to match the
dimensions (have the same length as the number of rows
or columns). An example "doing it by hand":

* Rows: `c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)` (only 2_nd_ row)
* Columns: `c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)` (only 1_th_ \& 3_th_ column)
* Attributes: `drop = FALSE` (do not drop)

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Our matrix
x
```

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Subsetting
x[c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE),
  c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE),
  drop = FALSE]
```

## Subsetting by name

Very useful is subsetting by name. This is, again, similar
to subsetting named vectors, except that we do have two
dimensions here:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Only "Col A"
x[, "Col A"]
# The element "Row 3", "Col B"
x["Row 3", "Col B"]
```

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Or "Col A" * "Col C"
z <- x[, "Col A"] - x[, "Col C"]
z
class(z)
names(z)
```

You may again use `drop = FALSE`. If not (`drop = TRUE`, the default)
the result will be a named vector.

## Non-existing elements in matrices

From vectors we know that an `NA` will be returned
if we access an element which does not exist, e.g.,
if we try to access element 10 (`x[10L]`) in a vector `x`
which only contains `5` elements.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
x <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)
x[10]       # non-existent, returns NA
```

For matrices, when using `x[<rowindex>, <colindex>]` the stroy
is a bit different: we will run into an ERROR which looks
as follows:

```r
x <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
x[10,10]  # non-existent, error!
Error in x[10, 10] : subscript out of bounds
```

Whenever you run into this error: check your indices/names/matrix dimension!

## The subset method

There is a generic method called `subset`. The method can
also be used on vectors (but not very useful). However, when
dealing with matrices the `subset` method becomes interesting,
and will be even more important on data.frames.

`subset` can be used to subset a matrix similar to the ways
we have learned above, however, the usage is different
and may be more convenient. According to the _R_ documentation
(see `?subset` or `help("subset")`):

```r
## S3 method for class 'matrix'
subset(x, subset, select, drop = FALSE, ...)
```

* `x`: object to be subsetted
* `subset`: logical expression, indicating rows to keep
* `select`: expression, indicating columns to keep
* `drop`: drop attributes (default for `subset` is `FALSE`)

**Note:** that the default for `drop` is `FALSE` when calling
`subset(...)`!

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
x <- matrix(NA, ncol = 3, nrow = 4)
rownames(x) <- c("Tom", "Lea", "Reto", "Emma")
colnames(x) <- c("age", "size", "kids")
x[,1] <- c(23, 34, 22, 28)
x[,2] <- c(1.79, 1.73, 1.80, 1.51)
x[,3] <- c(1, 3, 0, 0)
```

Imagine we have a matrix `x` which looks as follows:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
x # Our matrix
```


The row names correspond to the given name of a set 
of people, the column names to some attributes
(age of the person, body size, and number of kids).
We can easily use `subset` to extract all individuals
smaller than 1.75 using the `subset` argument:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
subset(x, subset = x[, "size"] < 1.75)
```


**Note:** `x[, "size"] < 1.75` does column subsetting by
name (takes the column `"size"`) and checks whether or not
each element in `x[, "size"]` is smaller than 1.75. If so,
a logical `TRUE` will be returned, `FALSE` else. Thus,
`x[, "size"] < 1.75` is doing nothing else than creating
**a logical vector** (try to execute this to see what's
returned by `x[, "size"] < 1.75`)!

We can, of course, also use a more complex logical statement,
e.g., searching for all individuals smaller than 1.80 and
not younger than 30 years old (`&`, the logical and):

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
subset(x, subset = x[, "size"] < 1.80 & x[, "age"] < 30)
```

So far we have only used the `subset` input argument which
subsets on rows. The `select` argument can be used to subset
columns. An example:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
subset(x, select = "kids")
```

This only returns us the `kids` column.
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
x[, c("kids"), drop = TRUE]
```


Or we **combine** `subset` and `select:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
subset(x, subset = x[, "size"] < 1.80 & x[, "age"] < 30,
          select = c("size", "kids"))
```


## Matrix Arithmetic

### Matrices and scalars

Matrices in _R_ are often used for arithmetics when solving
mathematical problems. In principle, all basic arithmetic
operations work element-wise as for vectors:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
x <- matrix(1:4, ncol = 2)
```

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
x # Demo matrix
```

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Addition
x + 2
# Multiplication
x * 1.5
```

The same is true for all other operations
(e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `%%`, `sin(...)`, `cos(...)`, ...).

### Matrices and vectors

What happens if we e.g., multiply a matrix of
dimension $2 \times 2$ with a vector of length $2$?
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
x <- matrix(1:4, ncol = 2)
y <- c(10, 100)
```

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
x # Demo matrix
dim(x)
y # Demo vector
length(y)
```

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Multiplication
x * y
```

**Note:*** _R_ recycles the vector! The vector is shorter than
the matrix (vector length 2, matrix length 4). Thus, _R_ simply
re-uses the vector two times!

In detail, the following happens: _R_ spans up a matrix
`y` which matches `x` and looks as follows:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
matrix(y, ncol = 2, nrow = 2)
```

Afterwards, `x` and this "`y` matrix" are multiplied.
This does not result in an error or warning as the length
of the matrix (4) is divisible by the length of the vector (2).

## Further functions

I don't want to talk about matrix arithmetics in detail. However,
_R_ can do 'all' you need, e.g.,:

* `t(x)`: transpose `x`
* `diag(x)`: diagonal of `x`
* `x \%*\% y`: matrix multiplication
* `solve(x)`: compute the inverse of `x`
* `crossprod(x, y)`: cross product
* `outer(x, y)`: outer product
* `det(x)`: calculate determinant
* `qr(x)`: QR decomposition
* ...
for those interested in linear algebra/math with _R_, you
may have a look at:
* See `?matmult` or `help("matmult")` for more details

## Practical Exercises (part 2)

Note that there are no solutions in this file, there's an
extra file on OLAT with a detailed solution to the following
short exercises.

### Practical exercise 3

Create the following matrix:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
x <- matrix(rep(c(10, 20), each = 3), ncol = 2,
            dimnames = list(c("Row 1", "Row 2", "Row 3"), c("Column A", "Column B")))
print(x)
```

From the matrix above, create:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
t(x)
```

and:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
x * rep(c(0.5, 2), each = 3)
```

### Practical exercise 4

Create the following matrix (medals table, Olympic winter games 2018).
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
Bronce <- c(11L, 7L, 10L, 6L)
Silver <- c(14L, 10L, 8L, 8L)
Gold   <- c(14L, 14L, 11L, 9L)
x <- cbind(Bronce, Silver, Gold)
rownames(x) <- c("Norway", "Germany", "Canada", "USA")
print(x)
```

Compute the sum of medals per country (e.g., use a `for`
loop) and add it to the matrix to get:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
Total <- rowSums(x)
x <- cbind(x, Total)
print(x)
```

### Practical exercise 5

Create the following matrix:
```{r, fig.align = "center"}
set.seed(1234)
x <- matrix(sample(-20:20, size = 25),
            nrow = 5, ncol = 5)
x
```

Create a nested `for` loop:

* first, loop over the rows
* second, loop over the columns

Check if the element `x[i, j]` is
**negative**. If so, multiply it with itself
and store it on `x[i, j]`.
