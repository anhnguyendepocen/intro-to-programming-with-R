# Getting Help

There are several ways to find help for _R_ commands and functions.
E.g.,:

1. "ask google" (not recommended)
2. use Rs built in documentation
3. html version(s) of the _R_ documentation
4. package manuals and vignettes
5. make use of online communities

What people typically do nowadays is to "ask google" or similar
search engines. However, this is _not recommended_, at least not
if help for specific functions or commands is needed!
If you search online, especially if 
especially if the query is not very precise, you may end
up with a broad range of possible solutions of different flavors
and quickly end up installing 20 new packages ... which might not
be needed.

## Accessing R documentation/help pages

_R_ comes with built in documentation for all (exported) functions
which can easily be accessed trough the console (or the IDE) by calling
`?<command>` or `help(<command>)` where `<command>` is what you are looking for. As an example:
we would like to know how the `mean` function works (arithmetic mean) and
what options it offers.

* `?mean` or `help(mean)`: will open the help page for the arithmetic mean
* `?plot` or `help(mean)`: will open the `plot` help page
* `?"?"` or `help("?")`: will open the help page for 'how to open the help page'
* `?"+"` or `help("+")`: opens the help page for arithmetic operators

The advantage of the _R_ documentation help pages: as they are loaded
from your computer they fit _your version_ of the installed software
or package.

</div>

The documentation will help in the bottom left corner. Help pages typically
consist of:

* **function name** the **package** in which the command is included (`mean`
    is included in the `base` package)
* **title** and a brief **description** what the function does
* **usage**: how the function can be used
* **arguments**: available arguments
* **details**: more details about the function and the options
* **value**: the result; what will be returned when calling the function
* **references**: where to get some more information, if needed
* **see also**: commands/functions which might also be helpful
* **examples**: some (smaller) examples how the function can be used

**The advantage of the built in _R_ documentation:**
As the documentation comes with your _R_ installation or the
package you have installed the documentation fits your version
of the software! And it can also be used offline, if needed.

Examples: if the documentation contains examples one can easily
run these examples by calling the function `example(<command>)`.
Try `example(mean)` or `example(plot)` to see how it works.

If you don't know the exact command `help.search` allows to
search for help pages containing a specific keyword.
For example:

* `help.search("mean")` will return a list of help pages
    containing the word 'mean'
* This search can be refined (see `?help.search`). E.g.,
    we can search for help pages containing 'mean' in the
    'base' package by calling `help.search("mean", package = "base")`.

A similar function is `apropos`. Instead of a list `apropos` returns
a character vector of functions which contain the keyword in the function
name, e.g.,:

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
# Apropos mean
apropos("mean")
```

## Package documentation and vignettes

In addition to the built in help pages contributed _R_ packages
come with a PDF manual and, often but not necessarily, with
so called _vignettes_. A _vignette_ is an addition document
by the authors of a specific software package which provides
some introductory material and/or examples how to use the
software and are, in contrast to the manuals (technical
documentation) more "tutorial like".
This is often helpful when using a new package
for a specific task. As an example: the [zoo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=zoo)
(for time series data in _R_) comes with a range of useful
vignettes (see [https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=zoo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=zoo)).

The vignette 'zoo' (from the `zoo` package) can be accessed out
of the command line (_if `zoo` is intalled!_) by calling:

* `vignette("zoo", package = "zoo")`

Vignettes (and manuals) can also be found on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) for contributed packages.

## Websites

There are some websites providing access the _R_ documentation.
However, all they do is to parse the _R_ documentation and
present it as a html website. Looks nice, however not
really needed (and you do have to take care if you are reading
the manual matching the version of the software/package you
are using). As an example: _R_ documentation for `mean` on
[rdocumentation.org](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.5.3/topics/mean).

## Ask the community

If the documentation does not help you, you may consider
using one of the online communities like
[stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r),
however, do _not overuse_ them! Before asking a question:

* think about it once more
* check if someone else has already asked the same question
* when posting questions: write well-defined questions, provide
     sufficient information and (in the best case) provide
     a minimal which allows others to reproduce your problem.

**A bad example**

**A good example**

<img src="images/02/02_stackoverflow_2.png"> 

Select a title which already summarizes the question.
Be specific when asking the question and try to keep your
questions short (and general).
If possible provide a reproduceable minimal example such that
others can see what's going wrong. In addition, provide some
information about your current installation. The problem might
be connected to a specific _R_ version or package.
