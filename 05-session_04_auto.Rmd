## Function Recap

Just a short repetition of writing functions in _R_. During the last practical
session but also when going trough your submissions on Session 03 Exercise
A-C I've seen a lot of functions using Rs so called "lexical scoping"
feature.  Even if this works it is "not recommended to use" (at least not
for beginners as it might be confusing very quickly). The following two
images show two _R_ functions. The first one is the suggested way to write
functions.

**Explanation:** The function is, again, the simple power function
we have used several times. The function takes two inputs, namely
`x` and `power` and returns `x^power` at the end. Outside the function
we define a `x` and a `y`, call the function, and store the result
(the return of the function) on `z`. Several things to mention here:

* Everything you use in the function _should be explicitly defined as input
   to the function_ (here `x` and `power`).
* The objects `x` and `power` inside the function are only available inside
   the function (the gray box is kind of a "function container" or "box").
* The object `x` (red) defined _outside the function_ is not the same as the
   object `x` (turquoise) inside the function! Don't mix them up. The "red" `x`
   is defined in our workspace. We forward the value of the "red" `x` to the
   function as the first input argument. Inside the function the first
   input argument is also called `x` but is not the "red" `x`. This is a new
   object (thus, turquoise) and gets the same value as the "red" `x`.
* The second element of the function (`power`) is not defined in the workspace
   but gets the value of `y` as we call the function with `powfun(x, y)`.
   The function inputs do not have to match the objects outside the function.

**Explanation:** This shows what we _should not do_. Scoping is a thing, but
Try not to use it and try to understand what's happening if you do. In this case
the function is even wrong. What we wanted to do is to have a function which
has two inputs and returns the first input (`x`) to the power of the second input
(`power`). However, if you look closely we actually do something different.

* On our workspace we have two objects `x` and `y`. We then (as in the example
   above) call our function with `x` and `y` as inputs. So far, so good.
* The function now gets the input `x` and `power` (with the values from the two
   objects on our workspace), however **the function returns `x^y` instead of
   `x^power`**! Why does it still work? Scoping!
* We are using an object `y` inside the function, which has **never explicitly been
   defined as an input to the function**. _R_ now tries to find `y` and will find
   one defined on in our workspace (the "orange" one) and uses this one. Thus,
   the function works and - in this case - returns the correct result, but
   **due to the wrong reason**!.
* The `power` input is never used at all.
* Try to imagine what will happen if you now call `function(2, 2)`. Instead
   of returning `4` (`2^2`) the result on `z` will be `5.6568` as the function
   returns `2^y = 2^2.6 = 5.6568`.

Thus, always (always) define all variables you use inside functions as explicit
input arguments. And check your functions such that you only use objects you
specified as input arguments!

## Developing Functions

### Develop functions in steps

For those who have had troubles writing functions: try to develop
your functions in some kind of a multi-step approach by doing the following:

* 1. Start with a fresh script and develop your code without functions first.
* 2. As soon as everything works as it should, pack parts of the code into functions.
* 3. Adjust and check your function.
### Step 1: start without functions

As an example of a multi-step approach let's use the example from
Session 02. I start with a fresh script and develop my code to find
all females in the data set which are taller than the smallest man:
```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
rm(list = objects())        # Clear the whole workspace
load("height_extended.rds") # Loading the data set
objects()                   # Check objects

# Smallest male person
smallest_male <- min(height[gender == "m"])
print(smallest_male)

# Find females taller than smallest male, store index
idx <- which(gender == "f" & height > smallest_male)
print(idx)
print(name[idx])
```

### Step 2: pack parts of your code into a function

That works as expected! As I am now sure that the code runs and that
my script does what it has to do I can pack it into a function. Note
that the commands to clear the work space and the one command to load
the data set will be outside the function, the function should only
find the tall females.
```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
rm(list = objects())        # Clear the whole workspace
load("height_extended.rds") # Loading the data set
# Find females taller than the smallest male person
tall_females <- function(height, gender, name) {
  # Smallest male person
  smallest_male <- min(height[gender == "m"])

  # Find females taller than smallest male, store index
  idx <- which(gender == "f" & height > smallest_male)
  print(name[idx])
}

# Call function:
tall_females(height, gender, name)
```

### Step 3: adjust your function

Well, that looks good so far, but now we have to adjust our function.
In this case I've renamed my inputs (now `hgt`, `sex`, and `name`).
**WARNING:** as soon as you rename your inputs: adjust your code such
that it only uses these new objects (and not the old names, e.g.,
`height`). If you would use `height` inside the function you'll run into
the scoping problem again!
In addition, I've added some **input checks** and an explicit **return**
command at the end of the function.
```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
rm(list = objects())        # Clear the whole workspace
load("height_extended.rds") # Loading the data set
# Smallest male person
tall_females <- function(hgt, sex, name) {
  # Check inputs
  if(length(hgt) != length(sex) | length(hgt) != length(name)) {
    stop("Input arguments have to be of the same length")
  }
  # Find body size of smallest male person
  smallest_male <- min(hgt[sex == "m"])
  # Find females taller than smallest male, store index
  idx <- which(sex == "f" & hgt > smallest_male)
  # Return names (character) of females > smallest male
  return(name[idx])
}

# Call function:
tall_females(height, gender, name)
```

## Advanced: use script files

More advanced: I could now also copy the function into a second `.R` script
file which takes up all my functions. Once I moved the function to another
script I do have to `source` this script. `source` executes the script once,
in this case `example_functions.R`. If we would not do that _R_ would not
know the function `tall_females` as it has never been defined!

The cool thing of such function files: you can remove the function from your
main script file. Especially if the functions get longer and longer this helps
you to keep your main script readable. So far we have not used this, however,
feel free to try (and you will, for sure, have to start using it in your
coding career).

Your main script would, in this example, look as follows:
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide", fig.align = "center"}
fun <- c("tall_females <- function(hgt, sex, name) {",
         "    # Check inputs",
         "    if(length(hgt) != length(sex) | length(hgt) != length(name)) {",
         "        stop(\"Input arguments have to be of the same length\")",
         "    }",
         "    # Find body size of smallest male person",
         "    smallest_male <- min(hgt[sex == \"m\"])",
         "    # Find females taller than smallest male, store index",
         "    idx <- which(sex == \"f\" & hgt > smallest_male)",
         "    # Return names (character) of females > smallest male",
         "    return(name[idx])",
         "}")
writeLines(fun, "example_functions.R")
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
rm(list = objects())        # Clear the whole workspace
load("height_extended.rds") # Loading the data set

# Copied the function into a second file called "example_functions.R".
# Source function file (loads the function into the workspace)
source("example_functions.R")

# Call function:
tall_females(height, gender, name)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide", fig.align = "center"}
file.remove("example_functions.R")
```
